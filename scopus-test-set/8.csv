In turn, institutional quality is important for ensuring the sustainable development of the state. One of the key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is Goal 8-Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (SDG8). Achieving this goal is par-ticularly important both for Ukraine, which has faced serious demographic problems due to Russian military aggression, and for Poland, which has accepted a large number of refugees from Ukraine. The aim of the article is to determine the role of institutional quality in ensuring the implementation of SDG8 for Poland and Ukraine. To achieve this objective, the paper uses the following methods: visualisation, calculation of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, logarithmic transformations, Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF test), and Granger causality test. The study uses the World Bank's SDG 8 indicators as well as the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) for Ukraine and Poland. The data cover the period from 1996 to 2020. The calculation results showed that the correlations between WGI and SDG8 indicators are country-specific. The Granger test demonstrated that causal relationships between WGI and SDG8 indicators in the first and second differences of logarithms vary for Ukraine and Poland. The identified patterns allow us to conclude that the impact of the institutional environment on economic performance has cross-country variations. In ad-dition, the comparison of data for Ukraine and Poland shows that different institutions in the countries have dissimilar effects on employment and productivity by sector. All calculations were carried out by EViews 12 and Statistica programmes.","Adf-test; Employment; Granger Causality; Institutional Quality; Sdg 8; Worldwide Governance Indicators","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000324818"

SDG 8 aims to foster sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic development, as well as full and productive employment. Design/methodology/approach: The pilot study was conducted at a global automobile brand’s largest facility in Kocaeli/Turkey, where 102 employees participated in stakeholder meetings divided into 18 groups. Additionally, 46 employees were interviewed through focus groups and one-on-one sessions across nine encounters. The collected data were analyzed using deductive thematic analysis, interpreting codes and themes related to spatial politics, timing politics and hybrid working culture in the new work environment. Findings: Identified themes include individually focused tasks, virtual collaboration, agile working, socialization and urban interaction. These themes are then traced through the conceptual design proposal developed by the interior design team and discussed in relation to their alignment with SDG 8.2 (diversify, innovate and upgrade for economic productivity), SDG 8.4 (improve resource efficiency in consumption and production) and SDG 8.8 (protect labor rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers). Research limitations/implications: These three targets (for inclusivity and innovation, for environmentally sustainable and for employee well-being) were selected for their relevance in shaping the physical work environment. Originality/value: The key finding of this paper is the need for a deeper understanding of economic sustainability in interior design and the contribution of SDG 8 targets on the spatial, temporal and cultural dimensions of new work environments.

These enterprises navigate in a market characterised by social and economic complexity where work is performed by a diverse workforce. The relational work performed in such enterprises contributes to many of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In this chapter, SDG 8 “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” is considered. The chapter addresses how the resilience of work relationships is performed in practice, and how it can be analysed, presenting a theoretical framework for understanding rural tourism work. Drawing on the notion of “relational work” from economic sociology, the chapter offers a conceptual discussion aimed at developing a toolbox to analyse the boundary work between various types of relationships in the tourism labour market: formal and informal, professional and personal, as well as marketised and non-marketised work relationships. This toolbox captures important nuances in the labour market which are often overlooked. By studying these relationships, important learning leads to a better understanding of small-scale tourism enterprises and their role in rural tourism.","Informal Economy; Lifestyle; Relational Work; Resilience; Rural Tourism Enterprising; Tourism Work","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201802311"

This changing nature of work also manifests in the national and local context within which graduates operate. In Tanzania, the experience of students and graduates within the labour market is complex. With the growing number of university students and graduates, access to employment is still limited. This study explores how students' perspectives are featured in such discourses. Specifically, the study investigates students' views on how university education prepares them for future employment. The analysis is based on empirical data collected from focus group discussions with students at two Tanzanian universities. While students report that the emphasis on their learning in classes is firmly on developing employment competence, they also expressed their dissatisfaction with how the university curriculum is preparing them for the world of work. Issues raised include the imbalance between practical and theoretical learning and the irrelevance of the curriculum to the changing needs of society. This study argues for a university informed by human development and the capability approach to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work.","Curriculum; Development; Employability; Higher Education; Students; Tanzania; Curriculum; Educational Attainment; Employment; Higher Education; Labor Market; Student; University Sector; Tanzania","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165215547"

Firstly, it pays special attention to the nexus between the entrepreneur, resources, institutions, opportunities, necessities, and the environment for drawing a comprehensive picture of how individuals could use entrepreneurship for successful upward social mobility in a changing world. Secondly, it emphasizes the peculiar challenges that female entrepreneurs face, how those challenges can be overcome, and how female entrepreneurship may be a route to women's socio-economic advancement. Thirdly, it highlights the challenges faced by ethnic minority business owners and how such ethnic minority businesses could thrive amid institutional voids as well as direct and indirect forms of discrimination.

While economic growth may be a quantifiable target, the promotion of ‘decent’ work is more troublesome, as it comes with connotations of morality and respectability. In many places, the sex industry is constructed as the very opposite of ‘decent’—criminalised, stigmatised and warranting intervention, regulation and punishment. Yet, in this chapter, I argue that despite its reputation as ‘indecent’, the sex industry is one of the more inclusive forms of employment, particularly amongst migrant or disabled workers, who are often excluded from other ‘decent’ forms of work. This chapter takes a broad, global approach in understanding the construction of sex work outside of dominant, Western perspectives. Using a sex-positive perspective and incorporating sex worker testimony, sex work is reimagined as the viable strategy of income generation, economic participation and productive employment that it represents for many workers. Viewed through this lens, it becomes imperative that sex workers are included in the goal to promote safe and secure working environments for all workers. Much has been written about the vulnerability of sex workers, yet this is fuelled by their status as operating outside the bounds of ‘decent’ employment, as criminal, deviant or disreputable—in short, as workers who do not matter. Goal 8 must really apply to all workers, as stated, or risk perpetuating inequality and exclusion for the very groups it aims to support. Therefore, to ensure safe workplaces and labour rights and to advance the ability of marginalised groups to participate in employment, this chapter argues that the UN must advocate for the full decriminalisation of sex work around the world as part of the SDGs.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194561774"

Starting from the historical and sociological frameworks of ucdw and equal pay, the article then analyses the link between the two in an attempt to understand whether the legal achievement of gender equality is hindered by treating the two goals separately. In particular, it looks at the wording of Goal 5.4 and questions its inclusion in Goal 5 (‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’). Using a legal and feminist lens, it examines the consequences of not including ucdw in Goal 8 (‘Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all’). One of the key findings is that the omission of ucdw from Goal 8 perpetuates the idea that this type of work is not part of the formal labour market, ultimately reducing the chances of it being included in national agendas worldwide. It is therefore argued that a different structure for the gender equality goals would increase the chances of ucdw finally being recognized as formal work and included in and regulated by labour law.","2030 Agenda; Equal Pay; Gender Equality; Gender Pay Gap; Sustainable Development Goals; Target 5.4; Target 8.5; Unpaid Care And Domestic Work","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180583772"

It achieves this by first introducing the Club of Rome report the Limits to Growth which utilised a system dynamics computer model to simulate the interactions of five global economic subsystems (population, food production, industrial production, pollution and consumption of nonrenewable natural resources) (Meadows, Meadows, Randers, and Behrens III, 1972), the results of which posed serious challenges for global sustainability, to better understand and contextualise unconventional (also referred to as ‘extreme’) and ‘renewable’ energy production as examples of the paradoxical nature of sustainable development in the global capitalist economy. Demonstrating that unconventional energy production methods are much less efficient, more carbon intensive, more environmentally destructive and just as unsustainable, and that renewable energy relies on the extraction of nonrenewable natural resources such as lithium that result in similar environmental and social issues, this chapter will interrogate this and ask the question - is the capitalist system in its current form capable of making ‘sustainable development something more than the oxymoron it appears?'.","Capitalism; Extreme Energy; Lithium Mining; Renewable Energy; Sdgs; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122836263"

Needless to say, education is a fundamental goal that contributes to fulfillment of several other goals of equal importance. As such, higher education is a major factor in poverty alleviation, SDG1: “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”, through enhancing job opportunities, SDG8: “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that illiteracy and poverty are two major factors that produce poor health and poor social development, SDG3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. It is also known that low literacy impacts on mortality and quality of life. In this chapter, fundamental changes in education and higher education are outlined, particularly in innovation and entrepreneurship that are needed in order to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

What distinguishes Kaizen from other approaches is that these goals are attained through its process—one in which learning and inclusiveness are essential. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) call on member states to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth and decent work for all. Kaizen can contribute to achieving the kind of growth characterized by these attributes. In this chapter, I begin by providing an analytical perspective and discussion of key issues related to Kaizen (Sect. 1). Based on this discussion, I then review the goals, tools/methods, and process of Kaizen (Sect. 2). In Sect. 3, I discuss the relationship between Kaizen and the targets of the SDGs as well as learning, transformation, and quality of growth. In Sect. 4, I analyze outstanding experiences of Japan, the United States, Singapore, Thailand, and Tanzania which have introduced Kaizen or similar approaches in order to gather insights on the above-mentioned relationship. Based on the analysis of these experiences, we could conclude that Kaizen, total quality management (TQM), and related approaches were able to contribute to growth—and in particular to high-quality growth—by increasing productivity through learning. It could also facilitate transformation through enhancing learning capacity, an essential endowment for industrial transformation. These approaches are intrinsically inclusive, because they are approaches in which participation by all and their learning are essential. They are also able to contribute to sustainable growth because they reduce use of materials and improve energy efficiency by eradicating muda (wastefulness). Such approaches improve security and safety for workers as well through elimination of muri (excessiveness), mura (dispersion), and so forth. Therefore, Kaizen, TQM, and related approaches could contribute to the achievement of Goal 8 of SDGs by facilitating directly and indirectly sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work. However, it should be recognized that there are challenges to fully implementing these approaches in the many diverse contexts of developing countries and that further in-depth studies are needed to address these challenges effectively.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089329240"

This goal is consistent with the guidelines of the International Labor Organization's policies and programs to ensure the exercise of employment in conditions that respect human rights, individual freedoms and equality. Given this context, and reinforced by explicit provisions in the Constitution of the Federative Republic of 1988 that guide in the same direction, Brazil has developed public policies and important legislative changes related to the world of work. Over the last twenty years, more than fifty-five thousand Brazilian workers have been rescued from conditions analogous to slavery, according to data from the Secretariat of Labour Inspection. According to data from the Ministry of Labor, although expressly prohibited by law, child labor still affects 2.7 million Brazilian children. The country is the fourth in the world with the highest incidence of occupational accidents, according to data from the Ministry of Labor. The purpose of this article is to analyze the extent to which state performance has contributed to the effectiveness of decent work, as well as how the impacts brought about by the labor reform approved in the Brazilian National Congress in 2017 may interfere in the promotion of the exercise of work activity so that does not violate fundamental rights and guarantees to life, equality, security and freedom. The overcoming of problems related to decent work is central to the analysis of development, which, according to Amartya Sen, consists in removing limitations to the choices and opportunities for rational citizen action. In this way, the present article analyzes the effects of the public policies of valorization of decent work in the expansion of the freedom of the individuals, considered, simultaneously, like end of the development and like its main means. Some freedoms, including decent work, play an instrumental role in promoting the freedoms of other species and stimulate targeted initiatives to overcome deprivation. Therefore, analyzing the extent to which the Brazilian State has achieved success in promoting decent work becomes an extremely important task.","Amartya Sen; Decent Work; Development; Labor Reform; Public Policies","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150644913"

This is a very exciting period, with the advent of new investors. In this framework, a more structured funding system, besides more pervasive international relations, could transform space industry, and more in general Space Economy, in a global driver for development.

It critically examines the goal from two perspectives, the business approach advocated by the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the human right to full employment and decent work advocated by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and human rights NGOs. While full employment and decent work are indeed prominent in SDG 8, the 2030 Agenda embraces market-centred institutional arrangements that may present obstacles to achieving the goal. Specifically, grafting the human rights to full employment and decent work onto a business-oriented economic growth agenda in SDG 8 calls into question whether the 2030 Agenda enshrines full employment and decent work as human rights obligations of states or merely as benefits of economic growth. The article concludes that the ambiguity in SDG 8 presents both opportunities for human rights monitoring and accountability but also enhanced legitimacy for the business approach.","Decent Work; Economic And Social Rights; Full Employment; Sustainable Development Goals","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026518548"
