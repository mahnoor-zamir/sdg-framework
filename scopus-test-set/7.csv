As the world faces the severe consequences of climate change, the transition to renewable energy (RE) has become a critical focus of sustainable development strategies. Renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar, wind, and biomass are not only environmentally friendly but also essential for achieving long-term energy security and economic stability. The importance of RE is underscored by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG-7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. SDG-7 highlights the necessity of increasing the share of RE in the global energy mix, improving energy efficiency, and promoting international collaboration to enhance clean energy research and technology. This research explores how Bangladesh can achieve a 100 % reliable and adaptable renewable energy (RE) output by 2050, focusing on the transition away from gas, coal, and oil-based power systems as the primary strategy for reducing fossil carbon emissions. The study examines the pathways to establishing a fully decarbonized and cost-effective energy grid in Bangladesh, emphasizing the challenges of converting the existing non-renewable power grid into a flexible and reliable RE system. From both technological and energy perspectives, the research investigates alternative methods and technologies to conventional fossil-dependent power systems and their potential to lead Bangladesh into a post-fossil fuel era. As a result, the proposed Carbon-free Advanced Power Network (CAPN) 2021–2050 model will offer the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy generation solution, with minimal greenhouse gas emissions and a fully carbon-free output. Intelligent energy management systems will play a key role in this transition. According to the suggested roadmap, there will be no need to construct new gas, coal, furnace oil, or nuclear power plants, and the existing fossil fuel capacity will be gradually phased out as it reaches the end of its technological lifespan.","Bangladesh; Climate Change; Decarbonization; Energy Storage; Energy Transition; Microgrid; Prosumer; Renewable Energy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215069882"

The energy issue is addressed in Agenda 2030 as one of its 17 goals. The article presents research on the statistical evaluation of the level of implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 7, that is, ‘ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all’ in the 27 EU member states. Seven indicators measuring different areas of energy accessibility monitored by Eurostat were applied to evaluate the EU countries. A multivariate comparative analysis was used to create a synthetic measure, i.e., the zero unitarisation method. The empirical analysis resulted in a ranking of the 27 EU countries in terms of the level of SDG 7 in 2015–2023. In addition to the ranking, a classification of countries into groups of similar countries in terms of the level of SDG 7 in 2015 and 2023 was presented. Furthermore, countries with the most significant advancement and those with the greatest declines in achieving SDG 7 in 2023 compared to 2015 were proposed. A sensitivity analysis was applied to evaluate a robustness of the composite indicator. Research confirmed a downward differentiation of EU countries in terms of the degree of implementation of SDG 7. Denmark, Romania, and Sweden were the top three countries in 2015, and Denmark, Sweden, and Estonia in 2023. The countries that appeared the weakest in the implementation of SDG 7 were in 2015, Cyprus, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and in 2023, Belgium, Lithuania, Cyprus, and Luxembourg. Luxembourg, Ireland, and Malta made the greatest progress toward SDG 7. At the same time, the largest decline was observed in Spain. The research results highlighted the problems in implementing SDG 7 not only for the less developed countries, mainly in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, but also for the highly developed Western countries. The applied research procedure may help to identify areas for improvement needed in the effective implementation of SDG 7 in the EU member countries. The procedure, however, has limitations. These include, among others, using a linear approach, taking into account only variables measured by Eurostat or an ambiguous effect of energy consumption indicators on SDG 7 evaluation.","27 Eu Countries; Energy Access; Sdg 7; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Sustainable Development Goals; 27 Eu Country; Belgium; Denmark; Energy; Energy Access; Eu Countries; Luxembourg; Socio-economic Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Sustainable Development Goal 7; Green Development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007770458"

These issues demand urgent attention and coordinated action, as they threaten public health, environmental stability and socioeconomic well-being. One of the crucial goals of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Despite the notable economic growth in emerging nations, the shift from traditional to clean cooking energies has been sluggish, particularly, when examining the rural–urban divide. Conventional energy sources continue to pose severe threats to human health and environmental quality, making the transition to clean energy essential. While numerous studies have analyzed economic factors driving clean energy adoption in emerging nations, there has been limited attention to the role of institutions and democracy. This research utilizes secondary data from 20 emerging nations from 2000 to 2021 to address this gap. The study employs panel cointegration and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) models to investigate the impact of institutional quality and levels of democracy on the energy transition. The findings reveal that institutions and democracy play a significant role in adopting clean cooking energy. In all four empirical models, the coefficients for democracy and institutions are found to be 0.30, 0.35, 0.19, 0.30, and 1.89, 3.68, 3.92, and 7.98, respectively, indicating that stronger institutions and democracy increase the adoption of clean cooking energies. Moreover, macroeconomic factors such as foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, financial development, and economic growth contribute to improving clean energy supply and adoption; however, their positive effects are contingent on strong institutions. The study concludes that the success of macroeconomic strategies in promoting clean energy is intertwined with the quality of institutions and democratic governance. Based on these insights, the paper offers several policy recommendations to enhance the transition to clean cooking energy in emerging nations.","Clean Cooking Energy; Democracy; Fmols; Institutions; Panel Data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005997314"

""The aim is to evaluate its effectiveness in developing critical thinking and argumentative skills, while promoting awareness of sustainable energy aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (United Nations, 2015). Over two academic years (2022–2024), students participated in debates on various energy sources, including nuclear, wind, solar or tidal energy, among others. The debates encouraged students to engage with diverse perspectives, apply their theoretical knowledge, and defend positions contrary to their own beliefs. Surveys were conducted before and after the debates to assess changes in student opinions on the viability of different energy types. Post-debate surveys revealed significant shifts in perception, such as a 0.8-point increase in favourability towards tidal energy in the 2023–2024 cohort. Additionally, 88 % of students reported finding the debates engaging, and 87 % felt the activity improved their understanding of energy topics. To further assess the development of critical skills fostered by the debates, a rubric was designed and applied by the professor, focusing on areas such as argument clarity, use of evidence, and teamwork. This rubric provided valuable insights into students' skill progression throughout the activity, offering an objective perspective on the effectiveness of debate-based learning without impacting students' final grades.","Argumentative Skills; Chemical Engineering Education; Collaborative Learning; Critical Debates; Sdgs; Sustainable Energy; Students; Argumentative Skills; Chemical Engineering Education; Collaborative Learning; Critical Debate; Critical Thinking; Energy; In-class Debates; Sustainable Energy; Tidal Energy; United Nations; Tidal Power","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001993519"

DT is reshaping energy production, distribution, and consumption by integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and digital twins. While existing research has extensively documented individual technological applications, there remains a significant gap in understanding how these technologies interact synergistically in real-world implementations [11]. Comprehensive analyses comparing digital transformation outcomes across different socioeconomic contexts are limited, particularly regarding the scalability of swarm electrification models. These technologies collectively address the ‘three Ds’ – decentralisation, decarbonisation, and digitalisation – essential for the evolution of modern energy systems. By leveraging these innovations, the sector can significantly enhance efficiency, optimise renewable energy integration, and expand access to underserved regions. One of the most impactful applications of DT is in the realm of decentralised energy systems, exemplified by swarm electrification. This concept, pioneered by Groh et al [3], utilises interconnected solar home systems (SHSs) to form scalable microgrids that evolve from standalone setups to full integration with national grids. These systems empower communities by facilitating energy sharing, reducing operational costs, and creating new income streams. Case studies from Kenya, Madagascar, Yemen, Germany, and Bolivia demonstrate the real-world success of swarm electrification in bridging the energy access gap while advancing sustainability goals. AI plays a pivotal role in digital energy systems by enabling predictive maintenance, optimising energy flows, and improving system reliability. Algorithms analyse vast datasets in real time to forecast energy demand, detect anomalies, and automate grid management. IoT further complements AI by providing the physical infrastructure to gather and transmit data, enabling real-time monitoring and control of energy assets. Together, AI and IoT support the development of smart grids and energy communities, fostering greater flexibility and resilience in energy networks. Blockchain technology is emerging as a transformative tool for energy trading and distribution. By enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets, blockchain enhances transparency and reduces transaction costs. This decentralisation of energy trading allows consumers to become prosumers, actively participating in energy production and exchange. Projects such as Esmat et al. decentralised platforms exemplify how blockchain empowers individuals and communities to take ownership of their energy futures while ensuring security and scalability. Despite these advancements, the implementation of digital technologies in energy systems is facing significant challenges. High initial costs, the complexity of integration, and cybersecurity risks pose barriers to widespread deployment. Furthermore, the digital divide in underserved regions limits equitable access to these transformative solutions. Environmental concerns related to the energy consumption of digital infrastructures, such as data centres and blockchain networks, also require attention. Addressing these issues necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach involving policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers to create enabling environments for innovation. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of DT in advancing energy systems, focusing on AI, IoT, blockchain, and swarm electrification. It synthesises insights from over 100 scholarly sources, including real-world case studies, and evaluates the social, economic and technological impact of digitalisation on energy systems. The study adopts a mixed-method approach, integrating literature analysis, quantitative modelling, and case study evaluations to provide actionable insights for policymakers and industry practitioners. The findings of this review highlight the transformative potential of DT in addressing energy challenges, particularly in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 [2]: universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy. By adopting digital innovations, energy providers can enhance operational efficiency, integrate renewable energy sources, and support community-based energy initiatives. The concept of swarm electrification exemplifies how decentralised approaches can complement centralised grids, ensuring scalability and adaptability to local needs. Policy recommendations emphasise the need for financial incentives, capacity-building programmes, and regulatory frameworks to facilitate digital adoption. Investment in human capital is particularly critical, as skilled personnel are required to implement and manage complex digital systems. International cooperation and knowledge sharing are essential to ensure digital transformation efforts align with global sustainability goals. In conclusion, DT represents a paradigm shift in energy systems, offering solutions to some of the sector’s most pressing challenges. Realising its full potential requires overcoming technical, financial, and institutional barriers. This review underscores the importance of a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to harnessing the power of digital technologies for sustainable energy transitions.","Ai; Block-chain; Digital Transformation; Energy Models; Energy Systems; Iot","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217490829"

Aiming to enhance the performance of PSCs by replacing the typically used electron transport layers (ETLs: TiO<inf>2</inf>, SnO<inf>2</inf>, ZnO etc.), we theoretically investigated the viability of tungsten oxide (WO<inf>X</inf>) as a promising ETL for PSCs. Moreover, the effect of altering the energy levels of WO<inf>X</inf> on cell performance has also been analyzed through simulation. Initially, 12 (twelve) PSC structures having the combination of different perovskite (PSK: CsPbBr<inf>3</inf>, CsPbI<inf>3</inf>, FAPbBr<inf>3</inf>, FAPbI<inf>3</inf>) absorber layers with different organic hole transport layers (HTLs: Spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT, PEDOT:PSS) and a fixed ETL of WO<inf>X</inf> were optimized numerically for comparing their performance. As CsPbBr<inf>3</inf>-based PSCs showed the best performance, further simulations were performed by varying some WO<inf>X</inf>/CsPbBr<inf>3</inf> interface properties such as interface defect density, conduction band offset (CBO) between WO<inf>X</inf> and CsPbBr<inf>3</inf>, energy bandgap (E<inf>g</inf>) of WO<inf>X</inf> etc. Finally, the best-performed PSCs were found for the E<inf>g</inf> = 3.5 eV of WO<inf>X</inf> and the CBO of - 0.5 eV confirming the conduction band minimum (CBM) of WO<inf>X</inf> is lower than that of CsPbBr<inf>3</inf> by 0.5 eV. A properly chosen WO<inf>X</inf> layer enhanced the efficiency of CsPbBr<inf>3</inf>-based PSCs up to 14.65 %, 14.52 % and 16.09 %, aproaching the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit (16.37% for CsPbBr<inf>3</inf>-based solar cell) from the initial values of 11.39 %, 11.27 %, and 12.49 %, respectively. This study ensures WO<inf>X</inf> is a promising ETL for which a proper PSC structure having a suitable PSK and an HTL can improve cell performance. Moreover, the importance of modifying energy levels of ETL material in enhancing the performance of PSCs is explored. As a result, this study opens a path for the researchers to develop WO<inf>X</inf> having suitable CBM and E<inf>g</inf>, so that it can be well-suited with a properly matched PSK material resulting in enhanced cell performance.","Conduction Band Minimum; Conduction Band Offset; Electron Transport Layer; Perovskite Solar Cell; Scaps-1d; Sdg-7; Tungsten Oxide; Conducting Polymers; Conduction Bands; Defect Density; Energy Gap; Gallium Compounds; Grain Boundaries; Heat Losses; Indium Phosphide; Indium Sulfide; Layered Semiconductors; Leak Detection; Light Absorption; Pentodes; Perovskite; Selenium Compounds; Tin Compounds; Titanium Dioxide; Transparent Conducting Oxides; Tungsten Compounds; Work Function; Cell Performance; Conduction Band Offset; Conduction-band Minimum; Electron Transport Layers; Energy; Performance; Scaps-1d; Sdg-7; Solar Cell Structures; Tungsten Oxide; Perovskite Solar Cells","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203869197"

This study focuses on assessing the progress of SDG 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Achieving SDG 7 requires a dual strategy by strengthening environmental policy design and enhancing institutional frameworks to ensure credible, consistent, and enforceable implementation. We empirically test this proposition by investigating the nonlinear impact of environmental policy stringency and institutional quality on renewable energy consumption for OECD and non-OECD countries from 2015 to 2020. Using dynamic panel data threshold regression, we find that environmental policy stringency and institutional quality have threshold effects on renewable energy consumption. Specifically, surpassing the thresholds of 1.50 for aggregate and 0.50 for market-based environmental policy stringency leads to increases in renewable energy consumption by 8.6% and 12.2%, respectively. Moreover, aggregate environmental policy stringency increases renewable energy consumption from 7.5% to 15.1% at high thresholds of institutional quality. Disaggregated analysis further reveals that market-based instruments exert stronger effects, ranging from 8.6% to 23.4%, compared to nonmarket-based instruments, which show more moderate effects of about 6.2%–9.8%, at upper thresholds of institutional quality. These findings suggest that while progress toward SDG 7 is underway, it remains conditional on surpassing critical policy and institutional thresholds. To accelerate the energy transition, policymakers must prioritize the adoption of market-based environmental instruments and invest in strengthening institutional quality to ensure the effective design and enforcement of clean energy policies.","Dynamic Panel Data Threshold Regression; Environmental Policy Stringency; Institutional Quality; Renewable Energy Transition; Sustainable Development Goal 7 (sdg 7)","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010689152"

The aim of the research is to identify the best type of electricity generation for these territories using expert-based methods. Given the strategic importance of the Arctic for Russia's socio-economic development, solving issues related to the cost, availability, and reliability of energy supply in this region is essential. The study focuses on various types of power generation facilities located in the Russian Arctic. Strengthening energy security in these regions aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 7 (“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”), which was adopted as the core objective in the decision-making model based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Based on a review of the relevant literature and regulatory documents, the settlement of Tiksi in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was selected as a case study due to its need for power system modernization in line with energy security and sustainable development requirements. Using AHP, power generation options were evaluated based on key characteristics of the facilities. Among the alternatives considered—conventional nuclear power plants, floating nuclear power plants, and wind/solar power installations—the floating nuclear power plant was identified as the most appropriate solution for Tiksi. This option best meets the settlement’s needs in terms of cost-efficiency, energy accessibility, and supply stability. The scientific novelty of this research lies in the development and application of an expert-based framework for selecting optimal power generation technologies, taking into account the characteristics of both the territories and the generation options. The framework incorporates a two-tier expert evaluation using AHP, aligned with the requirements of energy security and sustainable development in Russia’s Arctic regions. This methodology for determining a priority generation facility can be adapted and expanded depending on the objectives of the study and the unique characteristics of the territory in which a modernization project is to be implemented. Additional selection criteria may be introduced, and new alternatives considered, in response to evolving conditions or specific research goals.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Energy Security; Energy Supply; Expertise; Power Generation; Russian Arctic; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009922989"

Since the adoption in 2015 of the new United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a lot of attention has been paid to the energy sector in particular. The SGD number 7 aims to ensure by 2030, access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Thus, understanding electricity consumption growth remains a fundamental aspect of achieving universal access to energy. This research aimed to investigate the multivariate modelling of yearly residual electricity consumption in Togo by conducting a comparative approach between different deep learning algorithms. The analysis uses a data-driven approach based on postpaid residential electricity consumption data from Togo Electricity Company, aggregated at the regional level, from 1994 to 2020. Alongside this consumption data, additional covariates were selected through a feature selection procedure. The data were modelled using deep learning algorithms. Three algorithms were used namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. The model’s performances were assessed using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. As a result, from this study, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model performed the best with an MAE of 6.2 GWh on the test set while MLP, CNN, and LSTM performed with an MAE of 9.1 GWh, 14.4 GWh, and 14.8 GWh respectively. These results revealed the potential of deep learning techniques in modelling yearly residential electricity consumption in Togo. Thus, the utility company can rely on a such deep learning model to right-size its residential electricity supply for a more sustainable energy use and a fair and cost-efficient green energy transition.","Deep Learning; Electricity Consumption; Growth; Modelling; Togo","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009208157"

This study focuses on the global energy transition to understand the factors that influence success or failure in achieving targets. First, the gap between the stated targets and our predictions was calculated. Next, the roles of economic, political, and environmental variables in determining this gap were analyzed. Data were collected from 63 countries from 2000 to 2022, ensuring the global representativeness and robustness of the results. Many countries may struggle to meet their renewable energy targets. Political stability, regulatory quality, and investment freedom play a remarkable role in helping countries get closer to achieving their targets. More industrialized countries with large populations face greater challenges due to high energy intensity. This paper aims to predict the propensity of countries to meet their energy targets by integrating the forecasting and analysis of the economic, political, and geographical factors that influence a green transition. The results provide new insights into how socioeconomic and geopolitical differences influence the energy transition, offering insights for more effective policies. It is argued that accelerated administrative procedures are needed to reduce investment uncertainty and improve energy systems’ flexibility. In addition, involving local communities in the decision-making process is important to ensure the acceptance of RE projects. Finally, introducing energy markets that reflect the characteristics of renewable sources is recommended to facilitate a more rapid and sustainable transition.","Energy Transition; Green Economy; Net-zero; Renewable Energy; Sdg-7; Sustainable Development; Green Development; Energy; Energy Targets; Energy Transitions; Global Challenges; Global Energy; Global Perspective; Green Economies; Net-zero; Renewable Energies; Sdg-7; Clean Energy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207387885"

The Distrito Tec area in Monterrey city is an academic complex and it was chosen for this study, which consisted of the indirect measurement of the average annual heat energy stored within the buildings’ cement structure. The aim was to obtain the annual accumulated electrical power in Wh per year that Peltier modules could provide in Distrito Tec, which is located in a city with solar irradiation levels above the world average. The proposal in this paper could encourage further investigation regarding this energy that is currently waste heat. More specifically, the results of this research highlight the importance of thermoelectric modules and seek to motivate research to improve their properties and make them more efficient and more viable as well. Thermoelectric modules have the potential to be part of the solution to sustainable development as presented in the United Nations SDG-7—ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.","Battery Pack; Data Regression; Thermal Energy; Thermal Simulation; Thermoelectric Module; Waste Heat Recovery; Peltier Effect; Waste Heat Utilization; Battery Pack; Data Regression; Electrical Energy; Energy; Me-xico; Peltier Module; Thermal; Thermal Simulations; Thermo-electric Modules; Waste-heat Recovery; Battery Pack","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203629751"

Improving access to reliable and affordable modern energy for cooking have far-reaching benefits on human health and the environment. In most developing countries, the use of solid biomass fuel (SBF) for cooking is widespread. Using a nationally representative household-level data from Ghana and the biprobit model, this paper examines the relationship between SBF and ill-health. The first stage results show that the adoption of SBF is significantly influenced by socio-economic factors, rental and dwelling status, food hardship, information about SBF, and geographical controls. The adoption of SBF for cooking increases the probability of a household reporting ill-health and frequently reporting ill-health by 25% each, respectively. The differential analysis indicates that charcoal has a moderate effect on ill-health relative to using wood as fuel for cooking. The findings of the study imply that households are more likely to improve their health with increasing affordability and use of clean cooking fuels. Government programs on the promotion of clean energy fuels must be intensified and make more accessible and affordable to households.","Biprobit; Ill-health; Solid Biomass Fuel; Tenancy And Occupancy Status","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199163006"

Using a policy coherence and feminist policy approach within an energy justice context, it traces the coherence of GESI policy through time and in relation to overall GESI policy objectives. Horizontal and internal coherence are assessed through the parallels/disjoints between energy-related periodic plans, policies, budgets, and GESI aims. The evolution of GESI in energy investments has been slow in part because of a narrow conceptualization of the policy problem and a lack of coherence and synchronization across documents, which undermines implementation of the GESI agenda.","Energy Justice; Gesi Energy Policy; Nepal; Policy Coherence; Budget Control; Investments; Energy; Energy Justices; Energy Sector; Energy Supplies; Gender And Social Inclusion Energy Policy; Inclusion Energy; Nepal; Policy Coherence; Social Inclusion; Universal Access; Energy Policy; Energy Planning; Energy Policy; Energy Resource; Social Inclusion; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192303980"

The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” Simultaneously, the European Union (EU) seeks to reduce emissions by 55 % by 2030. Decarbonization policies must be carefully considered to avoid adverse effects on vulnerable groups experiencing energy poverty. Solar technology offers a viable solution to decarbonize the building sector, reduce energy dependence on fossil fuels, and provide financial benefits to the public. Mapping solar potential is crucial to determine where investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is most advantageous to the populations who stand to benefit the most. We combine a solar potential mapping approach incorporating socio-economic indicators indicative of energy poverty, using off-the-shelf Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools that are easily replicated across cities facing energy poverty. Utilizing lowest common denominator data and analysis approaches, we offer creative and innovative mapping solutions. The socio-economic factors help to contextualise the benefits of distributed PV systems and highlight the need for mapping solar potential, in combination with energy poverty indicators for sustainable planning and policymaking. Our results for a case study in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, demonstrate high solar energy potential that could meet 29 % of the city's electricity needs, save citizens about M€ 43.84 annually, and pinpoint where to invest first for the highest gains. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to use these results to inform decarbonization policies to benefit low-income populations that are often missed in existing energy policies.","Built Environment; Bulgaria; Energy Consumption; Energy Poverty; Solar Potential; Decarbonization; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Energy Policy; Energy Utilization; Fossil Fuels; Investments; Solar Energy; Solar Power Generation; Sustainable Development; Built Environment; Bulgaria; Decarbonisation; Energy Poverties; Energy-consumption; Low Income Countries; Social Benefits; Solar Potential; Spatial Data; Sustainable Energy; Mapping; Alternative Energy; Energy Policy; Energy Use; European Union; Photovoltaic System; Solar Power; Spatial Data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192437551"

Therefore, renewable energy is crucial for achieving the SDGs by providing sustainable, clean, affordable energy solutions. This study aims to identify the scientific production and its evolution related to concentrated solar power (CSP) and provide an overview of system hybridization towards accessing their role in achieving the SDGs. The study analyzes recent publications on hybrid CSP over the past decade using bibliometric analysis. The findings reveal that hybrid CSP systems directly and indirectly contribute to the SDGs. For example, hybrid CSP power is directly related to SDGs 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 12 Responsible Consumption and Production. In contrast, cooling applications are indirectly connected to SDGs 1, No Poverty, and 3, Good Health and Wellbeing.

Among these technologies, is microbial fuel cell (MFC), which takes advantage of the electrical energy produced through the metabolic reactions of microorganisms when they encounter a substrate. This study assesses the electric power generation potential of MFC configured using as a substrate and source comprising a mixture of soil, sand, organic fertilizer, and ash in a proportion of 3:2:1:1/2. Native plants (Torenia fournieri, Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, Pentas lanceolata, Nephrolepis exaltata, Begonia semperflorens, or Asplenium nidus) were planted to promote the exchange of organic chemical species and nutrients for renewable electrical energy generation. The configuration, constituting a system of fuel cells with microorganisms and plants (Plant Microbial Fuel Cell, PMFC), demonstrated varying whose efficiency levels, determined by measuring the potential between the cell electrodes. The highest voltage obtained in the PMFCs was 0.609 V for the Begonia semperflorens plan, while the lowest was 0.069 V for Asplenium nidus. Torenia fournieri and Asplenium nidus presented the highest voltage peaks at 1.782 and 1.587 V, respectively. Of the plants studied, Nephrolepis exaltata and Asplenium nidus were the only surviving plants after the measurements. When all were connected in series, excluding Asplenium nidus due to its instability, it resulted in an average voltage of 1.856 V. The minimum recorded voltage was 1.540 V, and the maximum electrical potential reached 2.050 V. Analysis of the soil samples, along with the substrate before and after the experiment, identified six electrogenic bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Erwinia sp., Lactobacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., and Clostridium sp. The Escherichia coli was only present in the soil and substrate sample before the experiment, while the concentration of Pseudomonas sp. and Erwinia sp., increased. This study confirmed that PMFCs with low-cost substrates and native Caribbean plants, represent a promising technology that could drive energy development in developing countries, especially in remote areas lacking access to electricity. This implementation of PMFCs aligns with sustainable energy practices, offering a cost-effective strategy, that can be replicated globally, contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.","Bioelectrochemical Organisms; Electrodes; Electron Transfer; Microbial Fuel Cells; Organic Matter; Rhizodeposition; Cost Effectiveness; Developing Countries; Electrodes; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Impact; Environmental Technology; Escherichia Coli; Fertilizers; Organic Chemicals; Power Generation; Renewable Energy Resources; Soils; Substrates; Bio-electrochemical; Bioelectrochemical Organism; Electrical Energy; Electron Transfer; Erwinia Sp; High-voltages; Plant Microbial Fuel Cell; Power Generation Potential; Pseudomonas Sp; Rhizodeposition; Microbial Fuel Cells; Alternative Energy; Bacterium; Demand-side Management; Electrochemistry; Electrode; Fuel Cell; Ion Exchange; Microbial Activity; Organic Matter; Power Generation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180460337"

Despite its potential impact, existing literature reveals a gap in integrating the perspectives and contributions of these generations to sustainable energy practices. This oversight offers a significant opportunity for further investigation and integration of their preferences and behaviours into broader sustainability frameworks. The present study collected the responses of a survey of 128 participants of different generations in Italy on their attitude and trust in energy consumption and high-energy-efficient household appliances. The results present a substantial challenge for policy makers and businesses aiming to align their strategies with the values and expectations of this key demographic. The study calls for a more nuanced understanding of these generational differences to develop effective and sustainable energy strategies that resonate with the values of the youngest demographics, aligning these efforts with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.","Consumer Behaviour; Energy-consumption; Generation Z; Millennials; Multigeneration; Sdg7; Sustainable Development Goals; Comparatives Studies; Energy; Energy-consumption; Generation Z; Global Challenges; Millennials; Multi Generations; Sdg7; Sustainable Energy; Sustainable Practices; Clean Energy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207056003"

They represent resources and technologies that provide superior advantage to environmental sustenance. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass are considered green power sources, as they generate clean energy without emitting greenhouse gases and thus reducing global warming. Cost effectiveness of green power has contributed to its popularity and competitive with other non-renewable sources. Green power and green energy play a crucial role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Green power and energy are closely linked to several SDGs to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, climate action through protecting the planet’s ecosystem, promoting sustainable economic growth and decent work for all while fostering innovation. Investments in renewable energy could save up to $4.2 trillion per year. Many countries have committed to installing 698 gigawatts (GW) of sustainable energy sources by 2030. Digital technologies have become instrumental in energy management enabling the adoption and efficient use of green power and green energy. Digital tools such as smart grids, energy storage systems and management systems provide real-time data on energy consumption and production, enabling more efficient use of energy and greater control over costs. Smart grids also enable the integration of renewable energy sources into the existing grid. The other areas of intervention of digital technologies are innovative business models such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms for trading excess energy generated from renewable energy systems. Furthermore, machine learning and artificial intelligence and blockchain technology is being explored for the creation of decentralized energy systems. In conclusion, digital technologies are instrumental in facilitating the adoption and efficient use of green power and energy. The continued development and deployment of digital technologies will play a critical role in accelerating the awareness and transition to a sustainable energy future.","Block Chain; Digital Technologies; Green Power; Machine Learning; Optimizing Green Energy; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205124447"

One of the critical goals developed was SDG 7, the all-inclusive access to affordable and clean energy for all by 2030. This study critically evaluates the progress of SDG 7 implementation in Ghana. This research paper heavily relies on document analysis and secondary data from sources such as gathering information from credible and up-to-date reports such as the 2021 Voluntary National Review (VNR) and the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) reports etc. Through the combination of policies, projects, and interventions, Ghana has made commendable progress toward realizing SDG 7. However, it is essential to highlight that only one of the five targets associated with SDG 7 has made significant strides. Distinctly, Target 7.1, which seeks to ensure all-inclusive access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030, has achieved an 86.3% attainment nationwide. This research discovered that though substantial advancements have been achieved in the power generation and distribution sector, the same cannot be said for establishing and integrating Renewable Energy sources (REs). The country continues to face significant challenges in adopting Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) and systems, usually stemming from high purchase and installation costs. To attain all the targets outlined in SDG 7 by 2030, stakeholders in the energy sector, particularly the government, must double up efforts in soliciting investment and allocating adequate resources towards the sector.","Affordable Energy; Clean Energy; Electricity; Ghana; Renewable Energy; Sdg 7","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205108777"

The means to achieving these outcomes is treating organic wastes using anaerobic digestion to produce a methane-rich gas, biogas. In the UK/EU, regulatory controls and fiscal incentives have been applied to promote the use of anaerobic digestion to treat such wastes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling food waste, while simultaneously producing renewable electricity, heat and biomethane. A brief review of the anaerobic digestion process and main process types is provided, in addition to considering different feedstock types. Reference is made to two anaerobic digestion technology scenarios that sought to identify the optimum technology combination to deliver gases/fuels to the commercial marketplace, based on the efficiency of energy production, energy capacity, avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and capital/operating costs. Project capital and operating costs vary with feedstocks, technology combinations and the outputs/end-uses, and developers/investors need to compare the estimated capital/operating costs of proposed projects to assess their economic viability. Using different metrics, it can be seen that organic wastes of different types can be treated successfully using wet/dry digestion technologies to produce biogas for on-site/off-site use as a fuel for gas engines/fuel cells, upgraded to biomethane for grid injection and/or liquefied for off-site use, or converted to hydrogen. The choice of plant size and technology combination/option are influenced by the choice of feedstock(s), which in turn influences both the capital and operating costs of a proposed plant and hence its viability. Anaerobic digestion is a technically and financially proven option, able to assist developed and developing countries to support many of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, including helping end poverty; zero hunger by promoting sustainable agriculture; ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation; and ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy; responsible consumption and production; climate action to combat the adverse impacts of climate change. The main focus of this chapter is how the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes provides positive outputs across a number of sustainability goals while minimizing the adverse environmental impacts of landfilling such wastes.","Anaerobic Digestion; Biogas; Energy; Food; Un Sustainability Goals; Wastes","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201819892"

The assessment considers the potential implications of the ongoing war in the country and analyzes how the achievement of ambitious mitigation goals could impact the indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goal on energy, SDG7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy). Results suggest that the net-zero transition would help improve several SDG7 indicators, including increased share of renewables in total final energy consumption, and increased energy affordability in the long run. However, in the medium run, increasing energy prices and rising investment needs might challenge the net-zero transition in the country. Overall cumulative investment needs increase by around 23% over the analyzed time horizon with the major portion being concentrated within the 2030–2045 timeframe. Major efforts need to be made to ensure the availability of a wide range of options for clean and green energy financing in Ukraine, including a reduction of the bond yield rates, creation of the specialized funds to support the ‘green’ transition, as well as the creation of a more competitive domestic environment through increasing mitigation ambition. If successfully implemented, these will allow Ukraine to rebuild the domestic energy system in a more technologically advanced and climate-friendly way, at the same time further supporting the country’s sustainable development agenda.","Energy Policy; Energy Utilization; Investments; Clean Energy; Energy; Energy Prices; Energy Systems; Energy-consumption; Final Energy; Renewables; System Wide Models; Time Horizons; Ukraine; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198474960"

It combines efforts to alleviate energy poverty with climate change action by setting worldwide objectives for boosting renewable and efficient energy consumption. Energy poverty is a significant problem in Europe that has worsened because of the Global Energy Crisis; the prevalence of energy poverty varies greatly throughout the continent, ranging from 0.3% to 27% of the population. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the Artificial Intelligence of Things has so far grown in significance and the research trends and emerging approaches using Artificial Intelligence of Things applications have been increasingly applied in the energy poverty context. There are not many works that use Artificial Intelligence of Things primarily to combat energy poverty. Nonetheless, several Artificial Intelligence of Things applications focusing on partial energy poverty features or on topics closely connected to energy poverty (income, energy prices, and building energy efficiency) have been released recently, allowing for the effective characterization of the issue. The primary objective of this chapter is to examine the role of the Internet of Things powered by Artificial Intelligence in addressing the issue of energy poverty. In this chapter, successful Artificial Intelligence of Things projects, in relation to the energy poverty and Sustainable Developments Goals are highlighted.

Our approach is based on night-time light (NTL) data. The methodology is designed and tested using mini-grid projects precisely localised and documented in published papers. We compare NTL data for each project before and after commissioning. We show that in about half the projects, NTL detects significant positive changes after commissioning. We build a test of impact, which confirms the causal nature of the observed effects of mini-grid projects on progress being made in SDG7, based on a comparison between non-treated localities matched with treated localities. But the domain of validity of this conclusion has limitations, related in particular to remoteness, extreme initial energy poverty and insufficient inclusiveness.

Among other options, these goals can be achieved by developing and introducing micro-scale combined heat and power systems powered by renewable energy sources, including solar and biomass energy. Considering renewable energy-powered cogeneration technologies, the most promising are steam/vapor turbines, Stirling engines, and thermoelectric generators. This paper focuses on the selected operational aspects and retrofitting optimization of the prototypical micro-cogeneration system powered by a biomass-fired batch boiler and operating according to the modified Rankine cycle. The existing installation was tested, and the amount of energy transferred from the oil to the condensate and steam and the efficiency of the evaporator and the superheater were determined. A retrofitting optimization aimed at maximizing the piston engine’s power output was conducted based on the results. In particular, it was shown that the system’s power output might be as high as 9 kW<inf>e</inf>. Moreover, the analyzed system featured a high energy utilization factor of 97.9% at optimal operating conditions. In general, it was shown that the micro-scale steam Rankine system may successfully serve as an alternative technology for micro- and distributed cogeneration systems. As a technology supplied with renewable biomass energy and operating on a cheap and environmentally friendly working medium (water), it fits very well into the idea of sustainable energy system development.","And Power Generation; Chp; Heat; Micro-cogeneration; Modified Rankine Cycle; Retrofitting Optimization; Sustainable Development; Alternative Energy; Biomass Power; Cogeneration; Combined Heat And Power; Installation; Operations Technology; Optimization; Power Generation; Sustainable Development; Thermodynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181947678"

This work analyzes some solutions to the lack of electricity supply in a rural community using organic waste from its economic activity and the integration of other available renewable sources to make electricity affordable and reliable. A model that minimizes the levelized cost of energy and restricts the proportion of annual energy not supplied to less than 5% of the community’s annual demand optimizes the performance of off-grid and on-grid systems. These systems have in common the production of electricity from biogas produced from swine manure, supplemented with wind and solar generation. Batteries and diesel generators support the operation of off-grid systems. As expected, the grid-connected system presented the best performance; however, the result reaffirms the need for governments to ensure the policy and infrastructure conditions that facilitate the grid connection of vulnerable communities to achieve SDG7.","Affordable Electricity; Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (hres); Reliable Electricity; Renewable Energy; Sdg7; Economics; Fertilizers; Manures; Rural Areas; Solar Power Generation; Affordable Electricity; Energy; Energy Systems; Hybrid Renewable Energies; Hybrid Renewable Energy System; Performance; Reliable Electricity; Renewable Energies; Rural Community; Sdg7; Renewable Energy Resources","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181845071"

Bioenergy is a form of renewable energy produced from organic materials, which can be used for generating power, while nutrition, on the other hand, is related to the ability of food to provide the proper nutrients to living beings and the factors that make up a healthy diet. The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has brought considerable attention to the importance of food security and nutrition, particularly under SDG2, while concurrently highlighting the need to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy access for all under SDG7. The accomplishment of these two Goals is crucial for almost all others, as they are closely interconnected with many cross-cutting elements and commonly framed in the Water Energy Food Nexus. In this context, modern bioenergy has the potential to aid in the accomplishment of the SDGs, when value chains and conversion processes are designed and managed in an appropriate and sustainable manner. Nevertheless, the positive relationship between bioenergy and nutrition is an overlooked nexus, whose analysis has been too often limited to the competition for resources, such as land, water, energy, and other inputs. Considering this, the present review was developed for both the nutrition and bioenergy communities to begin to overcome the limits of the food versus fuel paradigm, by analyzing this intricate nexus and bringing to light interlinkages and potential synergies existing between bioenergy and nutrition. So far, such linkages appear indirect or implied, therefore further research in this area would be beneficial. The strongest links between bioenergy and nutrition identified include: greater cooking efficiency, reduced indoor air pollution, and improved environmental sanitation through bioenergy clean cooking solutions; energy access for transporting, storing, and cooking food, thus reducing food loss and waste and diversifying diets; improved soil fertility through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), phytoremediation, and integrated biomass production systems; and better rural livelihoods and increased income by introducing bioenergy production and use as a circular economy practice. The major significance of this review is the identification of examples of good practices applied along the different stages of the bioenergy value chain with potential co-benefits for nutrition. In this way, this work aims to provide preliminary findings for researchers to better determine the ways in which bioenergy can be deployed to improve global nutrition.

The head on all the proposed sites was determined by taking the elevation difference between the proposed turbine and the intake at all sites. The discharge on all proposed ungauged sites was determined using ArcGIS for watershed delineation and the area ratio method along with Soil Conservation Service–Curve Number (SCS-CN) by using gauged data of Hunza River provided by Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) Pakistan at Daniyor bridge Gilgit, Shimshal and the Passo tributaries of Hunza River.

Yet, even if numerous initiatives and a significant amount of money are directly addressed to tackle the energy-access challenges, a billion people are still denied access to basic and modern electricity services, especially in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In the past two decades, the African continent has seen an encouraging improvement as the number of people gaining access to electricity rose from 9 million per year between 2000 and 2013 to 20 million per year between 2014 and 2019, outpacing population growth for the first time. However, most of those recent improvements are restricted mainly to urban and peri-urban areas of a small number of countries located in eastern or western Africa. Also, the population without access to electricity in Africa is expected to increase in the coming years following the health crisis and economic downturn caused by COVID-19. This definitely proves the fragility and poor resilience of the electrification solutions favored today.

We investigate the synergy and trade-off effects of electricity taxes on sustainable development goals (SDGs) for the EU. Using panel data and panel vector autoregressive estimation approach, we find that higher household electricity taxes reduce both carbon emission and unemployment. Higher levels of industry electricity taxes, increase responsible production and consumption (SDG12) and reduces unemployment (SDG8). Furthermore, there is evidence for a strong synergy effect between electricity taxes, unemployment and carbon emission but a trade-off between tax and SDG9 (innovation and sustainable infrastructure). The taxes contribute more to the future variation of unemployment and responsible production and consumption in the EU, but these contributions are much larger for the industry as compared to the household sector. Our results confirm the double-dividend hypothesis, which implies that the policymakers can achieve environmental goals with higher electricity taxes, especially on household electricity.

The concern on energy is also part of Sustainable Development Goals 7 whose objective is to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services and increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. On the other hand, the diplomatic effort is needed to accelerate the energy transition. Energy diplomacy is a growing diplomatic field which aims to enhance access to energy resources in order to provide energy security. The data in this study shown how energy diplomacy as one of successful methods to achieve SDG's 7 especially in the least developed country. However, energy diplomacy is not always fully successful in some countries. But it is undeniable that energy diplomacy plays an important role in the current level of multilateralism.","Co3o4; Hydrometallurgy; Jamborite.; Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (mhp); Nickel Laterite; Nio; Nioh","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160074450"

Specific cooperation plans and strategies have been implemented both at the regional and bilateral levels to strengthen the cooperation in this area between the two blocks. Despite this progress, crucial questions remain unanswered regarding the approaches, characteristics and rationale behind the green transition in the MENA context. This article focuses on the cooperation between five North African countries—Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt—and China under the BRI. It highlights how the initiative mobilizes funding and expertise urgently needed for developing and deploying clean technologies in North Africa. China’s ‘pragmatic’ approach to energy could speed up the transition in the region, but only if appropriate manufacturing capacities and a solid industrial base are developed in parallel with the deployment of renewables.

Specifically, a clean energy transition requires eco-social literacy to improve in relation to Sustainable Development Goal 7: to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Thus, it seems appropriate to clearly identify the key concepts that everyone should know in order to efficiently make the clean energy transition. The method employed in this study to introduce citizens to the topic has drawn on Spanish press coverage on clean energy over the last two years. MyNews data base, a digital archive of modern printed press in Spain, has provided us with access to 66 different journals to identify ‘clean energy key words’, and the information obtained has been cross-referenced with BBC web page information, the New York Post, Washington Post and various European Union and International Energy Agency reports, among others. Thus, it has been possible to observe how the European Union’s (EU) is leader on environmental, technological, investment and employment actions on clean energy transition. The two key questions to collect main concepts from the press have been: has the socio-economic effort been sufficient? And: what are the main challenges for a clean energy transition? The response has included reference to the latest EU regulations and the relevant emerging debates and controversies. The main themes that the press have addressed included the problem of renewable energy storage, how to obtain energy from what used to be waste (such as poultry manure or brine from the desalination of seawater), how to favour the circular economy, and other experimental initiatives, such as biopropane production and decarbonization in the tertiary sector (tourism and transport). This paper also asks whether clean energy can be a good option for decarbonization in the context of growing energy poverty. Taken together, this information made it possible to pin down the main concepts required to train citizens in eco-social literacy and to weigh up its pros and cons in an informed way.","Clean Energy; Decarbonization; Energy Transition; Geography; Sdg7","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184732278"

Further, authors observed that there are targets fixed by the state power regulator regarding Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) of power mandating to procure green energy. For sustainable development and inclusive growth in power sector, consumers who are consuming electricity need to be involved for power production and making them power producers. Those consumers are called Producers + Consumers (PROSUMERS). It has been analyzed whether green energy generated by 5 KW solar rooftop PROSUMERS will fulfill demand–supply energy gap or not. If not, then how many PROSUMERS will be required to participate to produce green energy to fill said gap. To analyze objective, demand–supply-related live primary data was obtained from said load category PROSUMERS onsite data loggers, while energy data was collected from state power regulator, namely Uttarakhand Electricity Regulatory Commission (UERC) and RPO-related secondary data attained from Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (UREDA), which is a government nodal agency in the state for renewable tasks.

To what United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) this combination could contribute? Those are the questions addressed in this perspective. SDG7 is aimed to ensure the access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable and modern energy for all. According to World Bank, ensuring access to modern food cooking solutions is a key component to achieving for SDG7, and -since cooking is mainly based on heating processing- also the access to modern food heating solutions must be considered as a key component to achieving for SDG7. Electro-heating applications (EHA) in food processing include all processes using the interaction of a food material or product with an electromagnetic field, as in microwave, radio-frequency, and moderate electric fields processing. These technologies involve the use of electrical and -more recently- electronic circuits and require professional figures in their design. As result, the installation cost of these technologies is way higher than installation cost for heating processes using fossil sources, as fuel for fire boilers, as an example. Furthermore, at industrial level, these technologies may require ad-hoc design. Consequently, the food processing industry is quite slow in embracing such technologies along the productive lines. Computer aided food engineering (CAFE) has been recognized as valuable approach to shifts the paradigm from trial-and-error-based design to model-based design, using digital tools for the virtual representation of a food product or process, predicting the behavior of it. The combination of CAFE and EHA is the only way to help the food industry to embrace sustainability in most operations in which the heat transfer is involved. This paper presents a viewpoint on the challenges and opportunity to combine CAFE and EHAs as contribution to food processing sustainability.","Computer Aided Food Engineering; Food Processing Sustainability; Microwaves; Moderate Electric Fields; Radio-frequency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158928298"

But from another point of view, the fundamental requirement of Sustainable Goal 7 is to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, where one of the key points is “reliable” which currently could be provided only by conventional fuel-burning power plants, e.g. coal-burning ones. Moreover in Ukrainian Power System, the coal-burning TPPs are important players providing all types of required reserves to insure overall grid stability, and the question of which electricity producers could provide a similar level of reserves currently does not have a well-grounded answer. Besides, the price for electricity produced by existing coal-burning plants compared to gas-burning ones which could replace them is lower, and this factor is very important both for the production sector to ensure its global competitiveness, and social sphere. That is why the stable operation of coal-burning TPPs in Ukraine will play an important role at least in the short term perspective—about the nearest 10 years, and the use of well-suited methods allowing accurate projection of TPPs’ coal-stock and hence the stable TPPs operation are important not only for grid resilience but for national energy security too.","Mathematical Modeling Technique; National Power System; Projected Available Stock Of Fuel; Projected Electric Energy Balance; Thermal Power Plant","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151288980"

The vanadium (IV) electrolyte-based nanofluid was studied with a different weight percentage of MXene (0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 1.5 wt%, and 2.0 wt%). Several physical, thermal and electrochemical characterizations like FTIR, UV-vis, SEM, EDX, and thermal properties measurements were performed. The FTIR, UV-vis and SEM, and EDX show there is no additional peak observed, the reduced light transmission capability was enhanced and smooth 2D layered structures of MXene were obtained.

This paper explores the reasons behind this development, tracing the programme run by the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) from its early expansion employing pioneering partnership and financing models, to its more recent decline. It finds that the government’s simultaneous implementation of several competing on- and off-grid energy access projects and lack of regulatory oversight alongside significant subsidy decreases which made SHS uncompetitive, led customers to abandon the programme. This, in turn, is putting at risk Bangladesh’s objective of achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7–affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all–by 2030. KEY POLICY INSIGHTS: The intended maturation of the market for off-grid solar did not occur alongside the gradual reduction of the SHS programme’s subsidy scheme. This resulted in a lack of service and technology providers and continued high system prices, unattainable to poor households in rural Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh’s unexpected grid expansion into SHS areas and introduction of free solar energy systems in 2015 further undermined the programme because it led to: o customer’s turning away from SHS and defaulting on their loan payments, leading to financial problems for IDCOL’s partner organizations.o entry of unregulated sub-standard panels into the market, resulting in a lack of confidence and distrust in the SHS by end-users.• A key role of the government is to ensure the sound quality of the systems and services from the outset to instil customer confidence in the product.• The creation of successful long-term energy access requires a comprehensive, integrated approach to coordinate stakeholders and oversee market development over time, ensuring that markets for new technologies and services such as SHS have an opportunity to succeed.","Off-grid Electrification; Rural Energy Access; Solar Pv; Sustainable Development Goals; Developing World; Electrification; Energy Policy; Photovoltaic System; Rural Area; Solar Power; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal; Bangladesh","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129130609"

Energy-impoverished communities are those that are dependent on traditional solid fuels and flammable hydrocarbons that are usually burnt in unsafe, inefficient and polluting stoves. The health and economic consequences are far-reaching, primarily through household air pollution, burn injuries and poisonings, with consequential health, neurological and psychological outcomes (Haagsma, et al., 2016; Wolf, Prüss-Ustün & Vickers, 2016). The socio-economic ramifications of the energy burden are enormous and generate social exclusion while limiting development in the affected countries (Guzowski, Martin & Zabaloy, 2021). With the accumulation of evidence of the impact of energy impoverishment, there have been increasing calls for expedited and inclusive transitions to safe and health-promotive energy. For such transitions to be truly just, they must centre on the needs of energy-impoverished people to ensure that no one is left behind (UNEP, 2021). There is also increasing consensus that access to safe and clean domestic energy is pivotal, if not a prerequisite, for a range of other global priorities beyond health, including environmental protection and sustainability, economic development and gender equality (Wolf et al., 2016). The significance of clean energy is highlighted in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with SDG 7 aiming for “universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030” (UNEP, 2021).","","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188906045"

In this context, the purpose of this paper is to assess the level of knowledge of the academic community about energy efficiency practices implemented during recent years by the University of Passo Fundo, in Brazil, and students, professors and employees’ energy behaviour. The paper intends to illustrate how education practices on energy efficiency can be added to universities’ actions to improve the progress towards reducing energy consumption and promoting occupants’ change of behaviour on campus. The methodology represents a case study of the University, based on a questionnaire applied to the academic community, with a sample of 400 respondents. The results showed that the university should invest more in its energy efficiency actions but always connecting these with the academic community and highlighting their importance for the success of the practices and for a more sustainable culture on campus. Our findings show the importance of connecting energy efficiency initiatives to the academic community’s behaviour, and especially of making these initiatives more visible and engaging. The contribution of this study is expected to support other educational institutions developing similar strategies in the energy context, but could also be useful to other sectors and sustainability topics, as the need for further dissemination and awareness-raising efforts is universal.","Energy Behaviour; Energy Conservation; Energy Efficiency; Sdgs; Sustainability; Universities; Alternative Energy; Energy Conservation; Energy Efficiency; Power Generation; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; University Sector; Brazil; Passo Fundo; Rio Grande Do Sul","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149641974"

A qualitative descriptive analysis based on two reliable databases and a survey procedure (Question 4) was used to answer the research questions posed. The goal was achieved by positively confirming three hypotheses and testing one negatively, relating to COVID-19’s slowing role in SDG7 implementation. The analysis showed that the 2020–2021 epidemic in Poland has led to more initiatives in this area, contrary to expectations. However, they were linked to the simultaneous implementation of other SDGs, which distorted their importance for achieving Goal 7. In summary, although energy companies were more active than expected during the epidemic, they had a low contribution to SDG 7. This also applies to local authorities.

As distributed energy resources (DER) proliferate, the existing power grid may be transformed into a carbon-free power system, ensuring that everyone has access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. However, there are some practical impediments and challenges in the transition of the global energy system. Hence, the present study aims to examine the benefits, technological advancements, problems, and solutions for establishing a global sustainable green grid. This study also provides a comprehensive literature review of strategic research direction relating to energy transition in various sectors; identification of major issues and challenges in renewable power network; investment requirements in clean electricity generation; operational challenges of 100% renewable integration into the power grids; and power pool interconnection issues for building a renewable energy system on a global scale. Through reviewing several emerging low-carbon technologies, this article offers insights into the feasibility and sustainability assessment of transnational clean electricity networks for supplying power throughout the world. The findings of this study highlight the potential of adopting variable renewable energy (VRE) systems in the development of a global eco-friendly grid. It also confirms that solar PV systems on a global scale of 8519 gigawatts would reduce 4.9 Gt of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fulfill 25% of global electricity demand by 2050. The review affirms that intercontinental solar power infrastructure can ensure solar power supply to solar power deficient countries, allowing the world to move toward a sustainable and clean energy future.

The Indonesian government improves electricity access through various programs, from the fast-track program for coal-fired power plants to the electricity subsidy for low-income households. In contrast, energy efficiency has been a crucial problem, given that most power plants work with coal. This study raised the electricity usage issue between insufficiency and efficiency by investigating factors associated with electricity consumption inequality using quantile regression in urban and rural areas. It revealed that most Indonesian households still encountered energy insufficiency. Households vulnerable to falling into the energy poverty category were low-income households characterized by: female-headed households in urban areas, non-educated household heads, renters in urban areas, elderlies, and self-employed in rural areas. On the other hand, energy efficiency may target high-usage households characterized by: urban self-employed, university-level education, and houses 2200 VA power outlet or more. However, only 1 % of households were electricity productive users. Therefore, the government should provide affirmative action by promoting access to affordable energy for energy-poor households while considering sustainable energy for future generations. This condition will mean clean and sustainable energy development must be embedded in the country's energy plan to increase the electrification ratio and consumption.","Electricity Consumption; Energy Efficiency; Energy Insufficiency; Quantile Regression; Urban And Rural; Coal; Coal Fired Power Plant; Electric Power Utilization; Energy Policy; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Planning; Rural Areas; Sustainable Development; Electricity Access; Electricity Usage; Electricity-consumption; Energy; Energy Insufficiency; Indonesia; Low Incomes; Quantile Regression; Urban And Rural; Urban Areas; Energy Efficiency; Accessibility; Alternative Energy; Efficiency Measurement; Electricity Supply; Energy Efficiency; Energy Planning; Household Energy; Low Income Population; Power Generation; Power Plant; Rural Area; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132981211"

The study uses 2018 Access to Clean Cooking Energy and Electricity – Survey of States data. It is found that while government schemes are effective in improving penetration, refilling cost of LPG and accessibility remain the principal hurdles. While fear attached with safety issues is found to be a dominant-negative determinants of LPG adoption, better health outcomes and user convenience are found to be major positive determinants associated with LPG use. Free availability, easy accessibility, and other benefits of solid biomass make it even impossible to eliminate fuel-stacking. It is suggested that provision of instant subsidies along with availablity of alternative income-generating opportunitie can reduce the burden of LPG refilling costs on households. Further, making provisions for the users to refill cylinders from the nearest authorised distributors could be a step forward to enhance LPG use. Effort towards promoting energy-efficient alternative technologies (e.g. solar cookers, kettles, etc.) and education, organisation of training programs with the help of local dealers and public institutions, and empowering women can go a long way to boost LPG use.","Clean Energy; Energy Policy; Fuel Stacking; Pmuy; Solid Biomass","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144817602"

Its use is expected to remain stable in the short term, with developing countries responsible for most of the increase in coal demand. However, coal-fired power plants contribute significantly to carbon dioxide emissions, with global climate change implications leading the United Nations (UN) to formulate a sustainable development goal (SDG-7) to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As this goal is dependent on the quality of fuel used in these plants, this paper considers a multi-objective fuel procurement planning model based on sustainability criteria comprising of economic, social, and environmental aspects. Unlike the conventional multi-objective optimization techniques for handling equally weighed non-substitutable criteria, the paper proposes a control criterion (CC) based interactive max-min approach that reshapes the feasible solution space, bypassing trade-offs to generate competitive solutions (CSs) for the model. The methodology takes into account a compensatory parameter lying in the range of 0 to 1 for possible improvement of the CSs in terms of non-dominance. Thus, the model provides flexibility to the decision-maker (DM) by offering multiple CSs from which the most suitable for the anticipated business scenario may be selected. We demonstrate the model by using a case study in the Indian context considering cash-flow generation from the plant as the CC.","Cashflow; Competitive System Design; Control Criterion; Fuel Procurement Portfolios; Multi-objective Optimization; Sustainable Operations; Carbon Dioxide; Coal; Coal Fired Power Plant; Decision Making; Developing Countries; Economic And Social Effects; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Global Warming; Sustainable Development; Cash Flow; Competitive System Design; Control Criteria; Design Frameworks; Fuel Procurement Portfolio; Multi Objective; Multi-objectives Optimization; Power- Generations; Short Term; Sustainable Operations; Multiobjective Optimization; Climate Change; Coal-fired Power Plant; Developing World; Optimization; Power Generation; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; India","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126132607"

Despite the worsening environmental condition, there have been limited studies on the causal agents of this situation in the region. Therefore, drawing strength from the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targeted impacts of 2030, this study explored the nexus between financial development and environmental sustainability in West Africa (WA) for the period 1990 to 2016. The cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) estimator alongside the cross-sectionally augmented distributed lag (CS-DL) and the cross-sectional augmented error correction (CAEC) estimators were engaged to examine the elastic effects of the explanatory variables on the explained variable and from the results, financial development was harmful to environmental sustainability in WA through high carbon emissions. Also, control variables foreign direct investments, energy consumption, industrialization, and population growth were detrimental to the sustainability of the environment. On the causal connections amid the series, a unidirectional causality from financial development and population growth to carbon emissions was uncovered. Also, feedback causalities between foreign direct investments and carbon emissions, between energy consumption and the effluents of carbon, and between industrialization and environmental pollution were unraveled. Based on the findings, the study recommended among others that the countries should integrate environmental welfare objectives into their financial development policies. Also, the nations should ensure that their citizens have access to energy that is affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern (SDG 7). Finally, improvement in energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and good use of resources (SDG 12) should be promoted by the nations. The above recommendations if seriously taken into consideration will help the region to combat climate change and its impacts, which is the focus of SDG 13. The main flaw of this exploration was the lack of data for some specific time periods. Therefore, in future when such data become available, similar investigations could be carried out to confirm the robustness of the study’s results.","Environmental Quality; Financial Development; Heterogeneous And Cross-sectionally Correlated Models; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); West Africa; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Elasticity; Financial System; Heterogeneity; Sustainability; Vector Autoregression; West Africa; Carbon Dioxide; Africa; Cross-sectional Study; Economic Development; Investment; Retraction Notice; Africa, Western; Carbon Dioxide; Cross-sectional Studies; Economic Development; Investments","Retracted","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115690344"

Recently, the de-dieselization program is one of the programs carried out by the Government of Indonesia through its state-owned electricity company, namely PLN, to convert diesel-powered electricity to green and sustainable hybrid PV-BESS power plants to electrify their remote and off-grid islands. However, this investment in hybrid PV-BESS power plants needs to be analyzed to see its attractiveness compared to the local electricity tariff. One of the methods is by analyzing the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of the hybrid Diesel-PV-Battery that is proposed in the de-dieselization program. As PV is variable renewable energy, the amount of PV penetration that goes into the system will highly depend on the size of the BESS. The higher PV penetration, the higher the BESS capacity which, therefore, the higher the LCOE. This paper studies the LCOE of the hybrid diesel-PV-BESS power plant with variation of PV penetration that can go into the system. From this study, it can be observed that it is essential to determine the PV-Battery capacity to achieve the lowest LCOE for a specific PV penetration. It also can be noted that when the PV penetration goes beyond 90%, especially if it goes to 100%, there is a substantial increase in LCOE since the PV-Battery required capacities also increase significantly. In this study, the optimum value of LCOE is 33.5 cUSD/kWh.

LECs are contextualized in the broader framework of the energy revolution started after Paris Agreements in December 2015 that led to the definition of 17 “sustainable development goals (SDGs)” by United Nations (UN) and to the establishment of the Clean Energy Package by European Commission in 2019. At global level, Energy Communities play a pivotal role to achieve United Nations SDG 7 (“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”) and 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”), the former more focused on rural communities and the latter more focused on urban context. This is even more true if thinking that reducing energy poverty, by bringing clean and affordable energy in rural areas through hybrid energy systems, is a fundamental strategy to develop rural contexts while also reducing migration toward urban areas and megacities. At European level, Energy Communities have a fundamental role in a consumer-centered energy system in which consumers and prosumers are fully engaged and play an active role both in single and in aggregated forms also with new forms of citizen participation (citizen energy communities). Indeed, LECs provide the right framework for increasing awareness, engagement, and empowerment of citizens in the energy sector. Moreover, LECs can be considered as multi-energy environments in which different energy systems and vectors can be integrated in order to optimally exploit the synergies among energy and non-energy networks (e.g. water distribution network and desalination systems). This is even more true when dealing with “geographical” or “energy” islands in which local energy communities are well identified by geographical or network boundaries. In the second part of the chapter, the authors will provide a vision on how the technologies and systems presented in this book, implemented in local multi-energy communities, can support the achievement of goal of a transition toward carbon-neutral energy systems. Finally, the authors present a vision for the future role of LECs in the energy transition, starting from the experience of European Green Deal.","Citizen Energy Communities; Consumer Empowerment; European Green Deal; Local Energy Communities; Local Integrated Energy Systems; Renewable Energy Communities","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146903491"

Access to energy as a fundamental human right that needs to be safeguarded by government actions and interventions has been advocated by some scholars. The study suggests that the concept of a ‘right to energy’ can serve as a good foundation and justification for governments and other actors to intervene or address issues such as lack of access to energy and energy services, energy poverty, energy injustice, and lack of energy democracy. Indeed, a rights-based concept establishes implications of the state's duties and obligations to tackle these issues. This study explores the possibility of a practical framework for developing or implementing policies that uphold a right to energy.

So far, there has not been an analysis of the RES convergence process across countries worldwide, given that the issue of climate change is a global externality. Previous analyses have focused on specific regions, such as EU, OECD, provinces of China. This paper fills this gap, providing new evidence on the convergence process of RES for the 176 countries that account for more than 98% of the world population, from 1990 to 2018. A common panel data set has been used to take into account countries’ specific effects. Several socio-economics and political variables are introduced to test conditional convergence such as openness to trade, developments in financial markets, income distribution, level of education. The results of this new contribution reveal that there is evidence of sigma-absolute and conditional beta-convergence process for several groups of countries. Moreover, the conditional convergence analysis shows that spatial spillover effects exert rich and complex impact on convergence speed. Finally, we provide policy recommendations, highlighting that the decarbonization target in 2050 needs additional mobilization of public and private resources to pursue a common, convergence path worldwide.","Conditional Convergence; Renewable Energy Sources; Worldwide Countries Data Set; Climate Change; Commerce; Renewable Energy Resources; Conditional Convergence; Convergence Process; Data Set; Energy; National Governments; Panel Data; Policy Actions; Renewable Energy Source; World Population; Worldwide Country Data Set; Sustainable Development; Alternative Energy; Convergence; Energy Resource; Environmental Economics; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Article; China; Diffusion; Education; Educational Status; Financial Market; Human; Human Experiment; Organisation For Economic Co-operation And Development; Renewable Energy; Velocity; Covid-19; Humans; Renewable Energy; Sars-cov-2; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107709897"

We provide new empirical evidence from ten countries describing the extent to which the current indicators underestimate energy poverty and neglect decent access. We find that households officially counted as having access to modern energy sources, in many instances, still benefit only from minimal energy services, receive unreliable energy supply, and struggle with being able to afford energy services they need to enjoy a decent standard of living. We also find that poorer households are systematically over-represented in this population and are more likely to suffer multi-dimensional constraints when counted served by the current indicators. Notwithstanding challenges in data collection and standardisation, we argue that we must improve on binary indicators for measuring progress towards SDG 7.1, to pave the way for agenda setting and policy development that recognises and addresses broad inequities in household capabilities to use modern energy towards achieving a decent living standard.","Energy Access; Indicators; Measurement; Multi-tier Framework; Sustainable Development Goals; Research; Alternative Framework; Critical Dimension; Energy Poverties; Energy Provisioning; Living Standards; Multi Dimensional; Policy Development; Standard Of Living; Environmental Engineering; Empirical Analysis; Energy Resource; Global Change; Household Survey; Policy Development; Poverty","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112747300"

Ukraine's energy sector is import-dependent, and one of the country’s sustainable development goals until 2030 is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy sources. The wind potential of the mainland of our country has been thoroughly studied, so the focus of our interest is water areas, which are promising for the development of offshore wind energy. Offshore wind farms in Ukraine could improve the environmental situation and considerably contribute to the decarbonization of domestic energy. That is why the study considers the opportunity of offshore wind farms installation in the Sea of Azov. Methods. The analysis of literary and cartographic sources has been carried out. Mathematical methods have been used to calculate energy indicators. Using geoinformation modeling, taking into account limiting factors, suitable for the installation of offshore wind farms areas have been identified in the Sea of Azov. The purpose of the article is to geographically analyze the wind energy potential of the Sea of Azov with further assessment of the suitability of areas for the offshore wind farms location. Results. Our research has shown that the installation of offshore wind farms is appropriate in the Sea of Azov, because many areas are characterized by average annual wind speed above 6 meters per second. The most promising areas are the northern and northeastern coasts, where wind speed at different altitudes ranges from 8 to 9.3 meters per second. At altitudes of 50, 100 and 200 m, under the action of limiting factors, the most promising for offshore wind turbines areas are reduced by 8–22%. As considered limiting factors (territorial waters, nature protection objects, settlements and airports) have identical influence regardless of height, it is more effective to in-stall wind turbines with a tower height of more than 100 m in the waters of the Sea of Azov. Interdisciplinary research is needed for the final answer on the effectiveness of offshore wind turbines in the Sea of Azov. Scientific novelty and practical significance. The results of the analysis of the wind energy potential of the Sea of Azov have been given, the tendency of its growth from the west to the east has been revealed. Attention has been paid to the method of geoinformation modeling of the location of offshore wind farms taking into account limiting factors. Maps of wind speed, potential of electricity generated by a single wind turbine and suitability of areas of the Sea of Azov for the location of offshore wind farms at an altitude of 200 m above sea level have been presented. These data can be used by designers of wind energy facilities as a basis for determining the optimal power of wind turbines and the type of energy for a particular area of the Sea of Azov.","Geographical Aspect; Offshore Wind Energy; Offshore Wind Power Plant; The Sea Of Azov; Ukraine; Wind Energy Potential","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213681217"

The results show that the main challenges faced by most local authorities are: the mobilization of financial resources, the inadequacy of own income, unreliability of central government transfers and weakness of financial management, economic uncertainty, the difficulty of balancing the reality of the local budget with reduced revenues, the widening gap between the availability of financial resources and municipal expenditure needs. Responsibility and financial resource management are the basis for the good governance of local governments, key drivers for public institutions on the improvement path and ensure sustainable development. To successfully implement sustainable development, for ensuring the financial resilience of local authorities it becomes crucial to develop a strategic financial management plan. Financial management can be a tool for improving the performance of local government. Only with effective local government, with financial resilience and sound public financial management, with the active engagement of local government and citizens, it will be possible to achieve the success of sustainable development including ending poverty in all its forms, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels are the mission of local government.","Financial Management; Financial Resilience; Fiscal Decentralization; Local Authorities; Local Budget; Local Government","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113176034"

The case is situated in sub-Saharan Africa during a UK-funded Global Challenges research project titled Energy and Forced Displacement: A Qualitative Approach to Light, Heat and Power in Refugee Camps and involves designers, anthropologists and associated stakeholders. The goal of the project is to understand ways in which qualitative methods, analysis and insights regarding energy requirements of the displaced communities can inform future policy practices for access to energy and the procurement of intermediary devices necessary to convert it. In this chapter, service and system design approaches are considered through anthropological perspectives, whereby energy objects are brought into the frame of analysis. Strategies of adaptation are witnessed, associated with transitions at the local level through frugal and informal approaches to innovation by the displaced communities themselves. The case study focuses on a particular set of entangled intermediaries relating to heating and cooking: firewood, charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The case study highlights that potential approaches for product and service design solutions are numerous, but a particular tension exists inherent within the SDG7 phrasing itself: that access to energy should be affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern. Our case study highlights the complex sets of entangled circumstances which often result in generic design approaches which do not yet currently fulfil the logical condition of ‘and’ in SDG7. More often than not, compromises are involved as a result of these top-down approaches to humanitarian design practices, which result in affordable, reliable, sustainable or modern energy within these particular communities, leading to suboptimal solutions and propositions.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109734122"

For achieving these goals, various models have been experimented amongst which Circular Economy (CE) is one of the economic models facilitating key policy objectives for generating economic growth and reducing environmental impacts. In economies, cities are focal points of strengthening the transition of linear to a circular economy by smart practices towards a regenerative system. By consuming the assets at their highest utility, there will be an increase in economic resilience of the city and its citizens. The Smart Cities (SCs) and Smart Cities Mission (SCM) of India, Make in India, Digital India, and the Swachh Bharat Mission has potential to integrate CE principles in a pronounced way to pave the way towards a circular transition. To fulfill the SCs objectives, Indian cities have been integrating smart practices (like waste management, e-governance, and smart mobility) with circularity. For the challenges faced by the cities from the design until the implementation phase, circular economy calls for a refit in resource management. These would require policy-level reforms, institutional capacity building, uplifting infrastructure, and financing mechanisms. In India, there is already an existing repair and refurbish culture with strong local traditions integrating the 6Rs. The paper reviews the role of CE in Indian SCM for achieving SDGs by finding opportunities for circular economy and providing recommendations based on them. A matrix has been developed between the ReSOLVE framework and the opportunities of CE in cities. The SCM has increased the pace of transition, yet the recommendations are given to implement the CE principles efficiently.","Circular Economy; Smart Cities; Sustainable Development; E-government; Economics; Environmental Impact; Environmental Protection; Planning; Smart City; Waste Management; Circular Transitions; Financing Mechanisms; Institutional Capacities; Production Patterns; Regenerative System; Resource Management; Sustainable Cities; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106203541"

The article aims to study the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions as they depend on the type and structure of economic activity in the Russian Federation (RF); to identify the impact of the pandemic and its consequences on the energy sector development and to justify the need to switch to renewable energy to ensure the sustainable economic development of Russia. Materials and Methods. In the process of conducting this study, statistical methods of analysis, system analysis method and the comparative method of analysis were used. Results. The results of the study have confirmed the need to switch to renewable energy in order to ensure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the environment (each unit of energy generated by RES will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50‐200 %). The reason is that the economy sector accounts for almost 79% of such emissions, which makes the transition to renewable energy relevant to ensuring the sustainable economic development of Russia. Conclusion. Achievement of the internationally recognized Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 7 «Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy Sources for All» in the context of a pandemic and its consequences necessitates energy sector reform. This could be achieved by increasing the share of renewable energy in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the environment and, accordingly, to prevent further climate change, one of the main causes of not only environmental but also of economic damage.","Economic Activity; Energy; Greenhouse Gases; Pandemic; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105472972"

A shift towards diversified, accessible bioenergy technologies will help to mitigate and adapt to the threats of climate change, decrease energy poverty, improve human health by reducing indoor pollution, increase energy resilience of communities, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Summary: Bioenergy derived from plants and fungi is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. There is rich untapped diversity in the plant and fungal kingdoms that offers potential to contribute to the shift away from fossil fuels and to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” Energy poverty—the lack of access to modern energy services—is most acute in the Global South where biodiversity is greatest and least investigated. Our systematic review of the literature over the last 5 years (2015–2020) indicates that research efforts have targeted a very small number of plant species cultivated at scale, mostly in temperate regions. The wealth of potential new sources of bioenergy in biodiverse regions, where the implementation of SDG7 is most urgently needed, has been largely overlooked. We recommend next steps for bioenergy stakeholders—research, industry, and government—to seize opportunities for innovation to alleviate energy poverty while protecting biodiversity. Small-scale energy production using native plant species in bioenergy landscapes overcomes many pitfalls associated with bioenergy crop monocultures, such as biodiversity loss and conflict with food production. Targeted trait-based screening of plant species and biological screening of fungi are required to characterize the potential of this resource. The benefits of diversified, accessible bioenergy go beyond the immediate urgency of energy poverty as more diverse agricultural landscapes are more resilient, store more carbon, and could also reduce the drivers of the climate and environmental emergencies.","Bioenergy; Biofuel; Biogas; Energy Poverty; Feedstock; Renewables; Research Effort; Sustainable Energy","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104813501"

GDP is growing by 3% annually and poverty rates are declining. Despite these gains, Kenya still has a lot of ground to cover to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. SDG7, which aims to 'Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all', exemplifies both Kenya's achievements and the challenges that remain. Access to grid-based electricity and LPG have grown rapidly. However, over 90% of Kenyans still rely on polluting fuels like wood, charcoal and/or kerosene for some or all of their cooking needs. Substantial effort is needed to ensure all Kenyans have access to clean cooking options by 2030. We present the results of a pilot study in which gasifier-based pellet stoves were introduced in 150 peri-urban households. The stoves include an internal fan that improves combustion efficiency and reduces emissions by 90%-99% relative to charcoal and fuelwood in traditional devices. A subset of participants received stoves with 'Pay-as-You-Cook' (PAYC) hardware, which relies on pre-paid RFID card to activate the stove's internal fan, allowing vendors to sell the stove below cost and recoup losses through pellet sales. We find that people were willing to include pellet stoves in their cooking routines and, in many cases, pellets displaced polluting fuels. We also find that PAYC hardware did not negatively impact adoption: PAYC users had higher daily rates of fuel consumption and reported higher willingness to pay for the stove than non-PAYC users. However, stoves were not used exclusively. Instead, people stacked pellets in combination with other cooking options, with pellets contributing to 12%-40% of their cooking needs (inter-quartile range). Though the project did not successfully overcome all of the barriers necessary to achieve long-term adoption of advanced pellet stoves, the results demonstrate that pellets could contribute to a portfolio of cleaner options.

One of the SDGs (i.e., SDG7) suggests that it is necessary to ensure energy access for all. In developing countries like India, the progress toward SDG7 has somewhat stagnated. The aging conventional electric power system has its dominant share of energy from fossil fuels, plagued with frequent power outages, and leaves many un-electrified areas. These are not characteristics of a sustainable and modern system in the context of the SDG7. Promoting renewable-based energy systems, especially in the context of microgrids (MGs), is one of the promising advances needed to rejuvenate the progress toward the SDG7. In this context, a hybrid renewable energy microgrid (HREM) is proposed that gives assurance for energy access to all in an affordable, reliable, and sustainable way through modern energy systems. In this paper, a techno-economic and environmental modeling of the grid-independent HREM and its optimization for a remote community in South India are presented. A case of HREM with a proposed configuration of photovoltaic/wind turbine/diesel generator/battery energy storage system (PV/WT/DG/BESS) was modeled to meet the community residential electric load requirements. This investigation dealt with the optimum sizes of the different components used in the HREM. The results of this model presented numerous feasible solutions. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the best solution from the four optimized results. From the results, it was established that a PV + DG + BESS based HREM was the most cost-effective configuration for the specific location. In addition, the obtained optimum solutions were mapped with the key criteria of the SDG7. This mapping also suggested that the PV + DG + BESS configuration falls within the context of the SDG7. Overall, it is understood that the proposed HREM would provide energy access to households that is affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern.","Community Microgrid; Energy Access To All; Environmental Analysis; Hybrid Renewable Energy Microgrid; Microgrid; Sdg7; Techno-economic Modeling; Alternative Energy; Developing World; Economic Analysis; Electrical Power; Fossil Fuel; Residential Energy; Sustainable Development Goal; India","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086178577"

Increased energy efficiency is particularly important in the construction industry because urban agglomerations currently consume up to 80% of global energy, 40% of which is attributable to buildings. In countries like Italy however, where historical buildings constitute a significant part of the building patrimony, improving energy efficiency is not always straightforward as interventions must take into account the historical materials used as well as the context of the construction. Therefore, the aim of this research was to establish a methodology that would identify the most effective means of achieving energy efficiency taking into account the historical aspects of a building and its cultural context. The methodology proposed and described in this paper involves: preliminary analyses to identify the elements of value and the level of transformability of facades; the selection of different insulating materials; dynamic simulations of building behaviour; analyses of intervention costs in relation to each type of insulation and finally the preparation of a multi-criteria matrix to identify the most effective method of improving energy efficiency of a historical wall with differing degrees of transformability. Each insulating material was analysed in relation to heating and cooling requirements and material cost impact. The methodology was applied to a case study in the Province of L'Aquila, Italy. In the paper a multicriteria framework, for the improvements in the thermal efficiency of a building, it is presented. Specifically the attention is focused on heating requirements, cooling requirements and cost impact. The results indicate that, with respect to historical building, it is possible to adopt strategies finalyzed to improve the energy efficiency of these buidings, contributing in this way, also toward the SDG7. Specifically, the best performance for a wall with a high level of transformability can be obtained using calcium silicate, extruded polystyrene, kenaf and hemp, whilst, in the case of a wall with a low level of transformability, the best materials are calcium silicate, polyurethane and linen fiber. Finally, in the case in which external constraints prevent the application of a thick coat and internally there is limited space, the use of calcium silicate was found to be the best energy efficient measure.","Energy Efficiency; Historical Buildings; Sdg 7; Sustainability; Calcium Silicate; Construction; Construction Industry; Cost Benefit Analysis; Hemp; Insulating Materials; Insulation; Silicates; Sustainable Development; Walls (structural Partitions); Cooling Requirements; External Constraints; Extruded Polystyrenes; Heating And Cooling; Historical Buildings; Preliminary Analysis; Sdg 7; Urban Agglomerations; Energy Efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076699769"

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by 193 nations in 2015, include, for the first time, a target to ensure access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy for all by 2030 [3]. In an analysis by IRENA [4] on the investment opportunities in the GCC, it is reported that close to 60% of the GCC's surface is hit by the sun and has significant potential for solar PV power systems. The European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) and Greenpeace expect that PV could provide up to 12% of electricity demand in European countries by 2020 [5]. Developing just 1% of this technology could eventually result in 470 GW of solar PV capacity. In its vision 2030 [ref], Saudi Arabia identified renewable energy as one of the pillars of economic diversification, away from oil, with an initial target set to 9.5 GW. The abundance of solar resource potential in KSA combined with the falling cost of associated technologies, including photovoltaic (PV) modules, represent the major factor behind the increased use of this source of energy. Recently, Saudi Arabia launched one of the Kingdom's largest project to build $500 billion mega-city business and industrial zone ""NEOM"" with a high ambition to make this new area running on 100% renewable energy. However, despite its abundance and the many advantages over other sources of energy, this technology is related to the challenging whether predictions and modeling accuracy. The integration of solar energy into the electrical network would be more efficient if the fluctuation of the Global Horizontal Irradiation/Irradiance (GHI) is more reliable and hence the PV energy output well predicted more accurately. Although a solar PV system relies on many components such as inverter, charge controller, batteries, and panels, forecasting the solar irradiation represents the main step in ensuring and designing an efficient solar PV system since it depends on several parameters namely, PV system location and orientation, daytime, and sunshine period. This paper attempts to develop a prediction model using the artificial neural network (ANN) [6, 7] for estimating the monthly average daily solar irradiation in the city of Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but, may be extended to other cities of the Kingdom. An in-depth ANN forecast method for solar irradiation is presented along with the statistical approach and techniques for predicting the Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI). By using case examples, it is possible to build models capable of predicting and generating rules that can be translated into natural query language and provide a measure of the confidence of the classification on the basis of its attributes. The data used in this study uses attributes such as variable weather and solar irradiation data of 10 cities provided by KACARE [8] as part of the Renewable Resource Monitoring and Mapping (RRMM) Program. The simulation is performed at Jeddah in an attempt to compare with the experimental measurements by KACARE and measurements done at Effat Solar PV system installed at the roof of the Deanship for Graduate Studies and Research (DGSR). An example of solar radiation and air temperature distributions computed using RETScreen [9], an energy management software created by the Government of Canada, to help predicting the viability and feasibility of energy project including renewable energy sources, is given in Figure 2. ANN method may use up to 12 attributes with MATLAB and/or WEKA [10]. The set of attributes being used for training are namely the time of the day, the year, the latitude and longitude, the air temperature, the wind speed and its direction, the azimuth angle, the diffuse horizontal irradiance, the direct horizontal irradiance, the global horizontal irradiance, the humidity, the pressure, and the zenith angle. The significance of this study relies on its capability of predicting the solar irradiation to quantify and improve the V system design, to ensure a secure and reliable electrical output, and to help electrical grid operators to manage the entire grid system. Another key element of this study is the outreach and dissemination of renewable energy technologies on Effat University campus, in addition to providing students with opportunities to perform experiments on the installed PV systems and to help Effat University becoming a leader in best practice campus sustainability.","And Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Ghi; Pv Systems; Solar Energy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080937397"

Successful significant financial and technological investments in RE in Namibia needs a comprehensive understanding of the correlation among diverse categories of investors and their enthusiasm to finance RE. Contrariwise, using the Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a measure for a wide-ranging and sustainable growth we recognize the interaction values that comes with RE. We studied the asset portfolios of diverse RE technologies supported or subsidized by various financial actors in Namibia.

Because of these sustained efforts, more than 1 billion people worldwide have gained access to electricity since 2000. During this course, the electrification architecture of developing regions has taken different forms, ranging from extensive utility grid extensions to limited off-grid solutions. Off-grid solutions generally offer cost-effective and lower up-front cost alternatives in comparison to utility grid extensions and are deemed more suitable for developing economies. In developing economies, these off-grid electrification solutions have evolved from individual solar home-based systems to community-based microgrids in pursuit of achieving higher efficiency and reliability on a village scale. Community grids responsible for the electrification of developing regions are further categorized based on architecture, type of generation, and mode distribution.","Cost Effectiveness; Community-based; Developing Economies; Developing Regions; Energy Services; Higher Efficiency; Mode Distribution; Off-grid Electrification; Universal Access; Electric Utilities","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057719919"

These SDGs underpin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that officially came into force in January 2016 and define a path to end poverty, ensure prosperity and protect the planet and its inhabitants. By grouping these priorities into seventeen goals and by establishing measurable and timebound objectives, the SDG foster global awareness, political accountability, improved metrics, social feedback, and public pressures. SDG7 is a dedicated, stand-along goal on energy which aims at ""ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all"". In this sense, renewable technologies such as Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) can immediately contribute to this SDG. However, under the right framework conditions, CSP can also contribute to the achievement of other SDGs. For example, CSP may also support human development by facilitating access to basic services, improving human health and supporting income generation activities. Additionally, CSP may also contribute to sustainable economic growth by generating economic benefits such job creation and industrial development. To demonstrate such linkages, the purpose of this work is (i) based on literature review, present a preliminary list of the potential contributions that CSP deployment could have in the various SDGs, (ii) propose the Framework for Integrated Sustainability Assessment (FISA) as a possible methodological framework to assess various of such impacts as well as results of a case study application and, finally, (iii) suggest other complementary impact assessment frameworks that could be used to evaluate the rest of CSP potential impacts on the various SDGs. To conclude, for each one of the SDGs, this work also presents some preliminary recommendations aimed at fostering the positive contributions of CSP deployment while minimizing the potential negative impacts on the SDGs.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057112607"

While the fraction of population dependent on solid fuels has declined in these nations over the last 25 years, the number of people using them has risen. Here, we first assess current patterns of cooking energy use in these nations. We then apply a discrete model of household cooking choices and demand to simulate future pathways of clean cooking uptake and the outlook for achieving target 7.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. We find that by 2030, ensuing income growth is likely to enable 90% of urban populations in these nations to switch to using modern cooking energy services. However, without supporting policies, between 40% to 50% of rural Guatemalans and Hondurans, while over two-thirds of rural Nicaraguans, are likely to find clean fuels or stoves unaffordable in 2030. A targeted subsidy on modern fuels, like liquid petroleum gas (LPG), is the most effective policy mechanism we studied that could provide such support. A 50% subsidy policy on LPG targeted to the rural and urban poor population could, by 2030, make cooking with LPG affordable to an additional 7.3 million people in these countries. We estimate that such a policy would cost about $250 million per year and would have negligible greenhouse gas emissions impacts. Such a policy could also have significant health benefits, preventing about 8,890 premature deaths annually from reduced exposure to cooking-related household pollution in 2030.","Liquefied Petroleum Gas; Liquefied Petroleum Gas; Article; Controlled Study; Cooking; Greenhouse Gas; Guatemala; Health Care Policy; Honduras; Household; Human; Information Processing; Modern Times; Nicaragua; Particulate Matter; Population Research; Reliability; Rural Area; Sustainable Development; Urban Area; Central America; Climate; Economics; Energy Resource; Health; Housing; Policy; Questionnaire; Statistical Model; Statistics And Numerical Data; Climate; Cooking; Energy-generating Resources; Health; Housing; Humans; Models, Statistical; Policy; Surveys And Questionnaires","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048198795"

Uninterrupted power supply is an essential requirement for urban as well as rural areas. In developing countries, steps are being taken to ensure 100% electrification. The total number of un-electrified villages in India is 3361 based on recent statistics. Many such villages are located in regions where grid extension could be uneconomical. Renewable energy based electrification systems offer a sustainable solution though they have the limitation of being dependent on a dilute and intermittent source. Integrated or Hybrid Energy Systems which combine multiple energy sources improve the situation. A hybrid system incorporating a diesel generator or any other dispatchable source of power along with a photovoltaic system would be preferable as compared to a purely photovoltaic based system. However, diesel based generators have the inherent limitations of being costly and unsustainable. Biomass gasifier integrated hybrid systems can be adopted in such cases where locally available biomass feedstock can be utilized for the system operation. Certain studies on system planning have been undertaken for biomass gasifier based hybrid energy systems in the past, specific to rural applications in developing economies. The salient features of biomass gasifier integrated hybrid systems for rural electrification from the design and operational point of view are discussed in this chapter. In India, biomass gasifier systems having a cumulative capacity of 18 MW are being used for meeting electricity needs in rural areas. Considering the potential of biomass energy source, its utilization in isolated power generation has been minimal in India. A study on the cost optimal design and performance assessment of biomass gasifier integrated hybrid systems is a vital step in this context. A case study involving the detailed design of biomass gasifier integrated hybrid energy system for a typical rural location in India following the design space approach is also presented in this chapter.","Battery Bank; Design Space; Gasifier Integrated Diesel Generator; Hybrid Energy System; Photovoltaic; Remote Electrification; Simulation; System Sizing; Biomass; Developing Countries; Diesel Engines; Electric Power Systems; Electric Utilities; Gas Generators; Hybrid Systems; Photovoltaic Cells; Solar Power Generation; Battery Banks; Design Spaces; Diesel Generators; Hybrid Energy System; Photovoltaic; Remote Electrification; Simulation; System Sizings; Rural Areas","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041737085"

This paper presents an energy planning model based on multicriteria optimization techniques, named SEPLAN (Sustainable Energy Planning). The SEPLAN model allows the incorporation of objectives that could be in conflict: for example, economic, environmental, or social objectives, as well as universal access to energy. In this model, six objective functions were established: replaceable amounts of fossil energy; CO<inf>2</inf>, NO<inf>X</inf>, and SO<inf>2</inf> avoidable emissions; cost minimization; and universal access to energy in isolated rural communities. Linear programming was applied to the six objective functions, and optimal solutions were chosen for each one. The efficient solutions were found with compromise programming, and Chebysev distance (L<inf>∞</inf>) was chosen as the Pareto optimal solution. The proposed model was applied in Cajamarca province, Peru. Cajamarca has the lowest electrification rate of the country due to the very high dispersion of households of rural communities. The results for the analysed scenarios provided the prioritization of the energy alternatives considered. When encouraging the objective function related to universal access to energy in isolated rural communities, photovoltaic solar energy was the priority in power energy generation. Thereby, the model could become a useful tool for decision makers.","Decision Making; Energy Policy; Linear Programming; Multiobjective Optimization; Optimal Systems; Pareto Principle; Solar Energy; Solar Power Generation; Sustainable Development; Compromise Programming; Multicriteria Optimization; Multicriteria Techniques; Pareto Optimal Solutions; Photovoltaic Solar Energy; Renewable Energy Source; Renewable Energy Using; Sustainable Energy Planning; Renewable Energy Resources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034600964"

With only 36% of Kenya’s population accessing electricity in 2014, demand will reach 18000 MW by 2030 when Kenya aspires to have universal electricity access.The gap necessitates the development of different generation sources if the energy system is to be affordable, reliable and secure.Kenya’s enormous potential in renewables and the significant demand-supply gap informs the choice of Kenya as a case study. Using Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization approach, we develop an efficient frontier with different portfolios containing several generating technologies.Policymakers can choose which portfolios to invest in depending on their risk-cost preferences. The preliminary results show that increasing the share of renewable energy in the portfolio reduces system risk and cost, even though renewable energies have relatively higher costs when considered as stand-alone investments. Although the study covers only Kenya, experiences of other (developing) countries are similar. Therefore these countries can benefit from the outcome of this study.","Energy Investment; Portfolio Optimization; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development; Costs; Electric Power Systems; Financial Data Processing; Geothermal Energy; Recycling; Risk Assessment; Sustainable Development; Demand Supplies; Efficient Frontier; Energy Investments; Energy Systems; Geothermal Sources; Mean-variance Portfolio Optimization; Portfolio Optimization; Renewable Energies; Investments","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065971950"

Secure energy provision and healthy ecosystems capable of delivering life-supporting ecosystem services provide the basis on which our economic system functions (Granit and Rosner, 2012). Natural resources serve as a key input to power generation. Energy produced, increasingly in the form of electricity, enables economic and social system services. Transport, commercial, industrial, communication and information systems all depend on a secure and reliable supply of energy. Without adequate energy supply a modern economy cannot function and inadequacies in energy supply may be translated into the poor economic performance of specific regions or countries. This has been well documented in the recently concluded UNFCCC Paris Agreement on Climate Change (UNGA, 2015) and the UN ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’. Target 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to ‘Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all’, highlights this relationship.","","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049951397"

The Sustainable /Development Goal seven (SDG7) aspires to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. This will require transition toward modern cooking fuels such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity. In Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC), 90 million people still rely on solid fuels for cooking. Access and price have been identified as the main factors that limit substitution of solid fuels by clean fuels. In this paper, we present an exploratory analysis of the effects of subsidy policies for LPG in reducing USF in LAC countries when controlling for indicators of socioeconomic development and urbanization. In LAC, subsidies to LPG have substantially contributed to accelerate the transition from USF to clean fuels for cooking. Targeted subsidies should be considered as a policy option to implement the SDG7 on clean energy. Making clean energy accessible to all has the co-benefits of preventing diseases and premature deaths. Understanding the transition processes from USF to cleaner fuels made by LAC countries can better inform policy making in other regions.","Indoor Air Pollution; Latin America; Lpg Fuel Subsidies; Economic And Social Effects; Health Risks; Indoor Air Pollution; Liquefied Petroleum Gas; Environmental Health Risks; Exploratory Analysis; Latin America; Latin Americans; Liquefied Petroleum Gas (lpg); Premature Death; Socio-economic Development; Transition Process; Fuels; Atmospheric Pollution; Cooking Appliance; Cost-benefit Analysis; Health Risk; Indoor Air; Liquefied Petroleum Gas; Subsidy System; Caribbean Islands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018992146"

The review of Ghana’s energy sector policy is to answer the question, what has been done so far? And what is the way forward? The future research in Ghana cannot progress without consulting the past. In order to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, Ghana has begun expanding her economy with the growing Ghanaian population as a way to meet the SDG (1), which seeks to end poverty and improve wellbeing. There are a number of intervention strategies by Ghana’s Energy sector which provides new, high-quality, and cost-competitive energy services to poor people and communities, thus alleviating poverty. Ghana’s Energy sector has initiated the National Electrification Scheme, a Self-Help Electrification Program, a National Offgrid Rural Electrification Program, and a Renewable Energy Development Program (REDP). The REDP aims to: assess the availability of renewable energy resources, examine the technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of promising renewable energy technologies, ensure the efficient production and use of the Ghana’s renewable energy resources, and develop an information base that facilitates the establishment of a planning framework for the rational development and the use of the Ghana’s renewable energy resources.","Africa; Developing Countries; Electricity Demand; Energy Balance; Energy Portfolio; Energy Sector; Ghana; Ghana Energy Commission; Renewable Energy Resources; Sustainable Development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975877301"

Access to clean, affordable and reliable energy are necessities in achieving a sustainable development in the modern world. Energy poverty in a country can be said to be a situation where its citizens lack electric power to meet even their own basic needs such as lighthing and cooking. Nigeria, as a country described as the “giant of Africa and the most populated black nation in the world still faces the crisis of energy poverty. Nigeria is blessed with an abundant energy resources of both fossil fuels and renewable energy (RE), but the main challege is the country’s inability to adequately and efficiently utilize these energy resources. This lack of efficent energy utilization has led to the near depletion of the fossil fuel resources within the country’s boarder and the energy crisis afflicting Nigeria is expected to be on the rise if the government does not act immediately by the diversification of country’s energy sources and exploit the abundant natural renewable resources avaliable in the country. This paper reviews the standpoint of efficent energy management with strategic concentration on the demand side energy savings and RE resource potential in Nigeria to ensure sustainable development. The energy situation in the country is reviewed with the consumption parttern of the various fossil fuel resources in the country. The paper also examined the various RE potentials, locations and present ways in which they can be harnessed for useful and uninterrupted energy supply. Some effective strategies and energy policy are presented in order to overcome the energy poverty situation in Nigeria.","Energy Poverty; Energy Savings; Nigeria; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Energy Development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927941574"
