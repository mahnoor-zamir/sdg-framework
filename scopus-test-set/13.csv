Starting with the ongoing discussion surrounding the development of an information architecture to support effective decision-making in decarbonization processes, this study explores the role of accounting models in measuring and reporting decarbonization effects and accountability models that ensure that firms track progress, take responsibility for their environmental and social impacts and address challenges. These models guide resource allocation and adoption of green technologies to meet sustainability targets. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to clarify how scholars have addressed issues regarding zero-carbon energy for mitigating climate change through accounting and accountability models. SLR was performed on 319 English articles published in the Scopus database and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2024. The results highlight that firms face extensive pressure from stakeholders and regulatory bodies regarding the legitimacy and transparency of decarbonization practices to meet zero-carbon energy requirements. The content analysis results revealed that sustainability reporting is useful for firms in rethinking decarbonization initiatives and linking them to the achievement of zero-carbon energy goals. Accounting and accountability models that embrace green technologies and renewable resources have increased institutional and stakeholder acceptance. This study is the first to examine how accounting and accountability systems can play a key role in firms through integrated thinking, which moves from integrated zero-carbon reporting to zero-carbon energy and the adoption of green technologies in decarbonization processes. This approach allowed us to discover accounting and accountability models through sustainable thinking for integrated accountability reporting during the twin transition process.","Climate Action (sdg13); Decarbonization Management Practice; Green Technology And Renewable Energy; Sustainability Reporting; Sustainability Transition; Zero-carbon Energy; Accountability; Alternative Energy; Climate Change; Literature Review; Management Practice; Renewable Resource; Technology Adoption","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001988447"

Its impact has been studied at environmental, health, economic and sustainable survival levels, but the toll that it takes on the mind, especially among the youth, needs further studies to highlight the impact. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of climate change on anxiety among adolescents and young adults in the Global South. Methods: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among students from all levels of education in the Global South. A total of 760 respondents including 202 from schools, 158 from colleges, and 400 from degree-awarding institutes and universities, (200 were undergraduates and 200 were graduates) voluntarily participated in the study. Based on their age and gender distribution, the average age was 18.56 years, 363 (47.7%) were males, and 397 (52.3%) were females. The Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS) was used to investigate the level of ecological anxiety among the youth in the Global South. The three categories of anxiety symptoms in terms of affective symptoms, behavioural symptoms, and personal impact were investigated. Results: The results revealed that the affective symptom shows a moderate positive and statistically significant relationship with age, higher the age higher the affective symptom of anxiety. The impact of income on affective symptoms, the respondents with a higher income have the highest mean (M=1.61), the higher the income the higher the affective symptoms of anxiety. To assess the difference in the anxiety symptoms based on the education level of respondents, the highest mean value was found among those with graduate (M=1.78), followed by college (M=.88), university (M=.83) and school (M=.82), which means that the highest affective symptoms are faced by graduate students. Conclusions: The results show a moderate positive and statistically significant relationship between age and income on anxiety symptoms, the higher the age and income higher the affective symptom of anxiety. The youth of the global south feel little anxiety due to climate change; this is detrimental and needs urgent remedial measures. To combat climate change requires a multi-pronged approach, with solutions ranging from personal responsibilities and actions to large-scale systemic changes to tackle this critical challenge.","Anxiety; Climate; Climate And Stress; Ecology; Global South; Pakistan; Sustainability; Adult; Anxiety; Article; Climate Change; Cross-sectional Study; Demographics; Eco-anxiety; Female; Hogg Eco Anxiety Scale; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Parameters; Psychological Cost; Questionnaire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000641853"

Recently, to tackle the so-called carbon leakage, the European Union (EU) introduced the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is a crucial instrument to establish a fair price for the carbon emissions during the production of certain carbon-intensive goods, including fertilizers. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the CBAM in addressing carbon leakage within the EU by evaluating the virtual carbon emission flows to the EU in the timespan 2019–2023, focusing on the top ten primary exporters of fertilizers. The assessment is based on the comparison of the world weighted average (WWA) emission factor and the country-specific one, to identify a more suitable method for measuring carbon emission flows. Results highlighted the opportunity of treating countries individually, rather than employing WWA emission factors. Emissions could be minimized by reducing production levels in countries with lax environmental policies, but this could penalize third-party economies. Sustainable development can be achieved by introducing fair environmental policies, maintaining constant production levels, economically compensating production economies, and exporting skills and know-how.","Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism; Carbon Footprint; Carbon Leakage; European Union; Fertilizer Trade; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Environmental Economics; Environmental Policy; European Union; Fertilizer; Leakage","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211773369"

Effectively addressing the multifaceted nexus of heat vulnerability and housing precarity necessitates the availability of geospatial microdata. Yet, given the idiosyncratic nature of ownership tenure within MMHC communities, sufficient microdata at the household unit level remain notably elusive through conventional tax records or other publicly available sources. In this paper, we assess how employing MapSwipe, a crowdsourcing application affiliated with the Missing Maps initiative, improves the completeness and precision of existing MMHC cartographic data inventory. Our approach harnesses MapSwipe’s micro-tasking methodology to identify absent MMHC locations within the state of Arizona. The contribution of this research is to present a viable methodology that organizes geospatial microdata around SDG initiatives and web-based volunteer mapping to effectively target the resources required to address the heat vulnerability of MMHC.","Cartography; Health; Heat Vulnerability; Housing","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197283555"

Both the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063 acknowledge the need to address these triple challenges. Within the SDGs, this is being pursued under SDG 2 (“Zero hunger”), SDG 13 (“Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”) and SDG 3 (“Ensure health lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”). Similarly, Agenda 2063 expresses this concern when emphasising the need to address climate change, ensure food security, as well as securing health for all. This chapter engages with the themes of women, climate change, food security and pandemics in Africa. It emerges from the realisation that all these challenges are gendered. Climate change, food insecurity and pandemics have a more devastating impact on women and girls than men and boys. Yet, African women have not surrendered to their fate. They are strategically placed to provide effective leadership, particularly from within their faith contexts.

However, emission from brick industries is a significant concern, particularly in a developing country like Bangladesh. Carbon Footprint (CF) is an important and widely used environmental indicator defined as the equivalent carbon dioxide emitted into the environment from the direct or indirect activities linked with the manufacturing process of a product. This study reports a detailed evaluation of CF of brick technologies and compares comprehensive carbon efficiency of different types of kilns currently operating in Bangladesh from the perspective of Carbon Footprint analysis. A field survey of six different types of brick kilns was conducted to collect information regarding fuel, electricity, soil, and water used in various operations of the brick manufacturing process. The assessment was carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Among the four different technologies, two Zigzag kilns showed the lowest CF values, 217.561 gm CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/kg fired brick and 218.798 gm CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/kg fired brick, accordingly, for the production of 100,000 bricks. In comparison, the two Fixed-Chimney Kilns (FCK) obtained a higher value of 291.096 gm CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/kg and 265.547 gm CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/kg. Despite being the most efficient technology, Tunnel Kiln showed a higher CF value than Hybrid Hoffman Kiln (HHK). Their CF values are 284.170 gm CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/kg fired brick and 266.795 gm CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/kg fired brick, respectively. This study also identified HHK with the lowest CF value of 203.768 gm CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/kg if fired with natural gas. Being the first carbon footprint study of the brick industry of Bangladesh as per the authors’ knowledge, this paper aims to help policymakers taking appropriate policy interventions to progress specifically in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal 10, i.e., take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.","Brick Kiln; Carbon Footprint; Chattogram–bangladesh; Co2 Emissions; Brick; Brickmaking; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Developing Countries; Emission Control; Kilns; Sustainable Development; Bangladesh; Brick Industry; Brick Kilns; Brick Production; Chattogram–bangladesh; Co 2 Emission; Development Programmes; Fired Bricks; Low Carbon; Manufacturing Process; Carbon Footprint","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184129455"

The WEF Nexus directly correlate life-changing Sustainable Development Goals-SGD-2 (zero hunger), SGD-6 (clean water and sanitation), SGD-7 (affordable and clean energy), SGD-9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SGD-12 (responsible consumption and production). Whereas climate-smart agricul-ture (CSA) is an integrated approach to address the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change. CSA correlates to SGD-13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). Climate change threatens people with food inse-curity, water scarcity, flooding, infectious diseases, extreme heat, economic losses, and displacement. Traditionally, global challenges, though interconnected, have been addressed singly, at times reducing one problem while exacerbating the others. In an idealized form, the nexus approach seeks to look at all three elements, i.e., food, energy, and water as an interrelated system. Hence, the nexus approach simultane-ously examines interactions and trade-offs and assesses accomplishments. The nexus approach focuses on strengthening synergies and reducing trade-offs among these sectors. SDGs are obliging us to work in an integrated way and not in silos. This chapter aims to hold a discussion on adopting CSA in the context of the progress on multiple sustainable development goals covering the WEF nexus while at the same time mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture. The chapter also focuses on identifying the knowledge gaps and discusses the interlinked roles of institutions, infrastructure, and information on developing policies by countries and international agencies. It is important to identify an array of tools and resources essen-tial for stakeholders in decision-making.

This educational endeavor is part of an effort to emphasize the significance of the Sustainable Development Goals 2015–2030 to students. The application focuses on Goal No. 13, “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”. In response to this challenge, countries agreed upon a course of action to address climate change in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which includes maintaining greenhouse gas emission trading markets. Despite the significance of emission rights markets, traditional introductory economics textbooks have not sufficiently addressed their treatment, as they rely on vague and difficult-to-understand verbal statements. On the other hand, typical intermediate advanced level Microeconomics manuals tend to depend on complex concepts and analytical tools that are challenging for a first-year student. In this sense, this chapter attempts to fill the gap between both approaches by offering an accessible presentation for first-year students. The primary objective of this teaching initiative is to help students comprehend the operation of emission rights markets and the rationale behind their use as an efficient strategy for reducing emissions. With this purpose, various scenarios are examined: unrestricted emissions, non-transferable rights, transferable rights, different rights initial distributions, non-free emissions rights and emission taxes. This educational proposal is grounded in the following principles: simplicity, collaborative learning and learning by teaching. It is important to highlight that this teaching experience addresses real issues that affect the lives of students, following an approach far removed from the traditional lecture format. This increases the degree of attendance, satisfaction, and enthusiasm of students in our course.","Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Collaborative Learning; Emission Rights; Curricula; Teaching; Transfer Learning; Artificial Intelligence Tools; Collaborative Learning; Course Of Action; Economic Course; Emission Rights; First Year Students; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Market Failures; Practical Experience; Teaching Experience; Students","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004532243"

It recognises that climate change is a global challenge that requires immediate attention and concerted efforts from governments, businesses, communities, and individuals worldwide. SDG13 permeates a number of SDGs and also influences them in a significant way. Based on the need to contextualise SDG13 and considering its role as one of the central SDGs, this article outlines the links between SDG13 and the other SDGs. It also reports on a survey involving experts from 61 countries. The findings suggest that even though climate change impacts, particularly extreme weather events, are known to disproportionally affect poorer and minoritized communities, the synergies among related goals and climate justice seem to receive less attention.

The variables of interest are carbon emissions measured in metric tons per capita, energy use measured as kg of oil equivalent per capita, and globalization index. To address five main objectives, we deploy four techniques: panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE), feasible generalized least squares (FGLS), quantile regression (QR), and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). For the most part, the findings reveal that the (1) inverted U-shaped energy-Kuznets curve holds; (2) U-shaped globalization-Kuznets curve is evident; (3) inverted U-shaped turning points for nonrenewable energy are 496.03 and 640.84, while for globalization are 38.83 and 39.04, respectively; (4) globalization-emission relationship indicates a U-shaped relationship at the median and 75th quantile; and (5) inverted U-shaped energy-Kuznets holds in Pakistan but a U-shaped nexus prevails in Nepal and Sri Lanka; inverted U-shaped globalization-Kuznets holds in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, but U-shaped nexus is evident in Bhutan, Maldives, and Nepal. Deductively, our results show that South Asia countries (at early stage of development) are faced with the hazardous substance that deteriorates human health. Moreover, the non-linear square term of the nonrenewable energy-emissions relationship is negative, which validates the inverted U-shaped EKC theory. Overall, the effect of energy and globalization on carbon emissions is opposite while the consistency at the 75th quantile result indicates that countries with intense globalization are prone to environmental degradation.","Carbon Emissions; Energy Use; Globalization; Kuznets Hypothesis; South Asia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Energy Use; Environmental Economics; Kuznets Curve; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Asia; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Human; India; International Cooperation; Renewable Energy; Asia, Southern; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Humans; Internationality; Renewable Energy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144732347"

In 2018, the annual energy consumption of rural residential buildings accounts for 28.17% of total buildings’ energy consumption in China. Therefore, it is important to understand and learn about rural residential building carbon emission characteristics compared to urban residences. In this study, the field investigation is carried out in 10 villages located in different suburban counties in Shanghai. DesignBuilder modeling simulation and carbon emission calculations are performed for Life-Cycle Assessment (fifty-year period) based on the investigation data of typical rural and urban residential buildings. Key features of carbon emission of selected houses are analyzed, such as major carbon emission stages of rural houses, main carbon emission spaces, building envelope characteristics, etc. It is shown that carbon emission in rural residences mainly comes from the use stage; bedrooms and living rooms are the main carbon emission spaces; the outer building envelopes, such as the external wall, ground floor, and roof, are the main contributor to energy consumption. In the future, corresponding solutions can be taken to reduce energy consumption according to the above characteristics in this study. The potential of carbon emission reduction is significant for general rural residential buildings in Shanghai, as a response to the UN SDGs Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.","Carbon Emission Characteristics; Field Investigation; Life-cycle Assessment; Shanghai Rural Residence","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193927123"

Without a doubt, future hotel experiences will need to have minimal impact on their environments, and this involves everyone from the housekeeper to the customer to the hotel director. However, the challenge of adopting a greener approach to hospitality is not as easy as it seems. Hotel staff, customers and management need to be supported in how to enhance/change their behaviours and day-to-day tasks/activities to ensure that they lessen the negative effect of their carbon footprint. Cutting-edge smart Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are currently being used by many hotels to track and monitor hotel operations and consumption. But this is only one side of the coin. In order for hotels to effectively go green, they need full buy-in from both their staff and customers. The authors of the paper fully advocate that the IoT technology implemented needs to effectively enable the hotel staff and customers with the ability and desire to adopt and cope with the act of ‘greening’/new ‘green’ practice. This paper discusses a study that probes in detail hotel housekeepers day-to-day activities in order to gain a more in-depth insight into their green needs. In detail it shows that hospitality staff are willing to be part of their hotel’s green initiatives. However, it has also shown that many of their attempted green practices are unsupported and left to estimates.","Green Hotels; Internet Of Things; Sustainability; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Hotels; Human Resource Management; Sales; Sustainable Development; Cutting Edges; Green Hotels; Hotel Managements; Hotel Staffs; Internet Of Things Technologies; Internet Of Things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177881814"

To illustrate the operationalization of these, we present three in-depth case studies of capital market-based impact investing funds in Ghana, drawing on relevant institutional and stakeholder theories. Our analysis suggests that explicit finance-first institutional logic is dominant in the African context, investing in green (renewables) activities. In addition, emerging evidence of impact investment funds are taking on transition elements in green finance, requiring the greening of existing brown industries. In view of the struggle to manage the tensions emerging from institutional logics, some fund managers have adopted hybrid logics as a potential solution to the challenge of merging the logics by some of these fund managers. Explicit strategies are found in funds that target renewables, climate change, adaptation, and resilience related to Goal 13 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). Implicit investment strategies are found in funds in which green credentials constitute one of many variables within broader impact metrics. The concluding discussion highlights important implications for green finance research policy and practice implications for policy and practitioners of environment-focused impact investment opportunities.","Commerce; Investments; Public Policy; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Case-studies; Fund Managers; Hybrid Logic; Institutional Logic; Institutional Theory; Investment Funds; Renewables; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Stakeholder Theory; Transition Element; Financial Markets","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176342900"

One such program is Virtual Reef Diver, which is designed to help monitor the health of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. This program engages citizen scientists in two ways. Scuba-divers are asked to take geo-coded underwater images of the reef and upload them to an online virtual reef. Members of the public across the world are then asked to classify these images with respect to key reef indicators such as coral. Through the lens of a Virtual Reef Diver event held as part of Australia’s National Science Week 2021, we describe important features of this program that positively address common concerns about CS data, including the scientific trustworthiness of the data, the ability to incorporate these data with other more traditional data sources, and the quantifiable improvement in information about reef health using these data for management decisions.

Theoretical considerations and data derived from Italian (both HSR and HSR/HCR), Spanish, and French HSR projects were used to set up and validate the proposed model. Results demonstrate that, under given conditions, it is possible to explain cost variability in terms of four main factors, namely high capacity (ACF), speed (SF), national (NF), and freight train factor (K), where this latter mainly refers to the need for longer tracks when freight trains are the main type of traffic.","Economic Sustainability; High–speed And High–capacity Railways; Infrastructure Costs Estimation; Economic Development; Economic Growth; Infrastructure Planning; Railway; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145888264"

Understanding how to govern AMR amidst evolving climatic changes is critical. Scenario planning offers a suitable approach. By envisioning alternative futures, stakeholders more effectively can identify consequences, anticipate problems, and better determine how to intervene. This study explored future worlds and actions that may successfully address AMR in a changing climate in a high-income country, using Sweden as the case. Methods: We conducted online scenario-building workshops and interviews with eight experts who explored: (1) how promising interventions (taxation of antimicrobials at point of sale, and infection prevention measures) could each combat AMR in 2050 in Sweden given our changing climate; and (2) actions to take starting in 2030 to ensure success in 2050. Transcripts were thematically analyzed to produce a narrative of participant validated alternative futures. Results: Recognizing AMR to be a global problem requiring global solutions, participants looked beyond Sweden to construct three alternative futures: (1) “Tax Burn Out” revealed taxation of antimicrobials as a low-impact intervention that creates inequities and thus would fail to address AMR without other interventions, such as infection prevention measures. (2) “Addressing the Basics” identified infection prevention measures as highly impactful at containing AMR in 2050 because they would contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which would be essential to tackling inequities underpinning AMR and climate change, and help to stabilize climate-induced mass migration and conflicts; and (3) ”Siloed Nations” described a movement toward nationalism and protectionism that would derail the “Addressing the Basics” scenario, threatening health and wellbeing of all. Several urgent actions were identified to combat AMR long-term regardless which future un-folds, such as global collaboration, and a holistic approach where AMR and climate change are addressed as interlinked issues. Conclusion: Our participatory scenario planning approach enabled participants from different sectors to create shared future visions and identify urgent actions to take that hinge on global collaboration, addressing AMR and climate change together, and achieving the SDGs to combat AMR under a changing climate.","Alternative Futures; Antimicrobial Resistance (amr); Climate Change; Interventions; Scenario Planning; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Sweden; Anti-bacterial Agents; Antiinfective Agent; Antibiotic Resistance; Climate Change; Human; Sustainable Development; Sweden; Anti-bacterial Agents; Climate Change; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134623722"

Unfortunately, these emissions have increased in recent years. Hence, cities and countries need plans to decarbonize their public transport fleets, and, more specifically, to replace fossil‐fueled buses with electric buses that produce zero CO2 emissions. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to present a method to decarbonize the bus fleet in Portugal by a scheduled replacement of the current fleet, which is fueled by fossil fuels, with a completely electric fleet, in fourteen years. The study shows that it is possible to replace all Portuguese urban bus fleets with electric vehicles considering that all vehicles will be replaced when reaching the age of 14 years. Replacing the urban bus fleet with zero‐emission buses would aid policymakers and bus companies to reduce the GHGs, and therefore contribute to fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely, Goal 13—take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.","Bus Fleet; Decarbonization; Electric Buses; Green Public Transport; Zero‐emissions; Climate Change; Decarbonization; Fleet Operations; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Planning; Sustainable Development; Urban Transportation; Bus Fleets; Decarbonisation; Electric Bus; Fleet Replacement; Green Public Transport; Portugal; Public Transport; Transport Sectors; Urban Bus; Zero Emission; Electric Buses","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132138558"

Thermal tolerance has been proposed as one of the possible adaptation strategies for animals affected by anthropogenic effects and excess heat from climate change. However, no scientometrics analysis of thermal tolerance research has been conducted to date. As a result, the goal of this study was to gather information from the literature to determine the current state of thermal tolerance, development trends, and current research. Researchers will be able to better understand the trends and development of the thematic research area of thermal tolerance by using scientometric analysis to generate data on thermal tolerance. For frequency, co-occurrence, co-citation, clustering, and burst analysis, CiteSpace software was used. The scientometric review of thermal tolerance studies from 1970 to 2021 (5243 studies) reveals significant increases in the size of the literature, the frequency of citations, and the hotspots investigated. Susan Lindquist and the Journal of Thermal Biology are the most influential authors and journals, respectively. The most common clusters related to the thematic area of thermal tolerance are oxygen consumption and heat shock protein, with climate change and temperature being one of the most popular keywords. We concluded that, along with the thriving field and climate change issues, thermal tolerance is becoming one of the future research interests.

This review aimed to assess the replacement of plastic usage with a better alternative, including studies on various types of cutlery, preparation of edible cutlery, therapeutical properties and the market of edible cutlery.They occur in everyday life, which compromises the standard of living. Plastic usage can be minimized with a better alternative, as complete eradication is not possible due to their consistent dependence and usage. So, a better substitute is cutlery made up of plantbased products like rice, sorghum, wheat, soy, and rice bran flour.

Many current policies and strategies to combat climate change impacts are focused on technical aspects of adaptations whereas little research is done to understand the socio-economic dimensions, particularly the perspectives of farmers. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with more than 800 farm-families residing in the Northeastern Region of India (NER), an Eastern Himalayan ecosystem. Results show that most farmers perceive changes in climate and are aware of its agricultural and socio-economic impacts. The majority of farmers from all eight NER states have personally experienced unusual climatic events within the last 10–15 years. About two-thirds believe that climate change is largely man-made and there is an urgent need to take action. Many farmers observed declining water availability and soil fertility across NER. High cost of agricultural inputs and unawareness of effective adaptation technologies are the core barriers for adaptation in NER. To sustain their livelihoods, vulnerable farmers have adopted a few low-cost measures. However, strategic interventions are highly advocated to empower human capital for enhancing socio-ecological resilience. In conclusion, to overcome the barriers of farm adaptations in NER, holistic support programs are needed, which raise awareness for suitable actions, reduce input costs, and facilitate access to financial credits.","Adoption Barriers; Agricultural Adaptation; Asian Monsoon; Climate Change Perception; Livelihood Vulnerability; Adaptation; Alternative Agriculture; Climate Change; Human Capital; Livelihood; Monsoon; Perception; Soil Fertility; Vulnerability; India; Northeastern Region; Thailand","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116348286"

Using data from 28 selected African countries covering 1990 to 2019 and deploying the FGLS, PCSE, and MM-QR techniques, findings reveal, among others, that: at the 1% significance level, a percentage change in energy use leads to between 0.60% and 0.70% increase in carbon emissions, on average, ceteris paribus. Correspondingly, income shows to be a positive driver of emissions contributing between 0.87% and 0.84% percentage increase, on average, ceteris paribus. Also, per capita income attenuates the impact of energy use on emissions by between -0.27% and -0.23%, on average, ceteris paribus. However, significant heterogeneities occur across the sub-regions. Specifically, Southern Africa shows the largest energy contributor to emissions 1.65% while Central Africa contributes the most to aggravating emissions by 1.87% through increase in per capita income. West Africa shows the largest moderation effect at -0.56%. Across the quartiles, the effects of energy use and per capita are positive. Given these, we submit that the strong correlation between energy usage and per capita income (i.e. economic growth) poses a dilemma for African economies in their drive for growth. Leaving room for trade-offs. Perhaps, the lesson is that as African countries seek for more development without contributing to carbon emissions, governments should invest more in renewable energy.","Algeria; Angola; Article; Benin; Botswana; Cameroon; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Congo; Controlled Study; Cote D'ivoire; Democratic Republic Congo; Economic Development; Egypt; Energy Consumption; Ethiopia; Gabon; Ghana; Income; Kenya; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; Mathematical Model; Mauritius; Morocco; Mozambique; Namibia; Niger; Nigeria; Renewable Energy; Senegal; South Africa; Sudan; Tanzania; Togo; Tunisia; Urbanization; Zambia; Zimbabwe; Africa; Investment; Sustainable Development; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Economic Development; Income; Investments; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118620363"

Hence the criticality of understanding climate change and its impact on agricultural output is more pressing than ever. This is in line with Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Regardless, Nigeria has in the past five decades experienced a significant increase in temperature, in the range of 10 to over 30 degree Celsius. Therefore, managing the effect of climate change on agricultural output now has the colouration of a developmental challenge. Design/methodology/approach: In light of this, this study gives due consideration to the impact of climate change on agricultural output between the years 1986 and 2015. For the purpose of analysis, descriptive statistics, unit root test and the ordinary least square (OLS) estimation technique were employed. Findings: Findings from the study reveal that the average annual rainfall, temperature and forest area positively influence agricultural output, whereas drought, floods and agricultural nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) emissions have negative impact on agricultural output. The study suggests the need for a regulatory framework and also an explicit national agricultural policy essential to offset the negative effects of climate change especially on agricultural output. Originality/value: As Nigeria look to diversify her economy which relied on oil, agriculture is among the alternative sector hoping to drive her economic growth, therefore, it is pertinent to examine the current output in the sector given the effects of climate change.","Agricultural Output; Climate Change; Economic Growth; Vulnerability; Weather; Climate Change; Economic Growth; Estimation Method; Input-output Analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; Vulnerability; Nigeria","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109810196"

This is witnessed in the increasing number of natural disasters and most notably in Asia and the Pacific (APAC), the region reported to be more afflicted than any other part of the world. Based on a multisource global data, we analyzed the trends, nature, and impacts of floods in the five sub-regions of APAC, including East and North-East Asia (ENEA), North and Central Asia (NCA), Southeast Asia (SEA), South and South-West Asia (SSWA), and the Pacific and Oceania (Pacific) between 1990 and 2018. The paper also described their implications on the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG13) —which calls on governments to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Analysis revealed upward trends of flood occurrences and impacts across the sub-regions of APAC. This not only poses a threat of undermining the economic growth and development attained over years as well as poverty eradication in APAC, especially in regions of ENEA, SEA and SSWA but also in curtailing the progress of achieving sustainable development by 2030. Fortunately, this study the first of its kind to explore the linkage between floods and SDGs strived to explain in particular, how SDG13 offers some of the salient mechanisms under its 5 targets to be leveraged in addressing and minimizing floods and their impacts in APAC.

Where scholarship on metagovernance—the combination of market, hierarchical and network governance—proposes deductive approaches to such challenges, we contend that a historically informed “abductive” approach offers valuable insight into the realpolitik of intergovernmental frameworks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a Foucauldian “archaeological–genealogical” method to investigate the inclusion of climate change as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). It analyses more than 100 documents and texts, tracking the statement forms that crystallise prevailing truth claims across the development of climate and SDG metagovernance. Findings: We show how the truth claims now enshrined in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change constrained the conceptualisation and operationalisation of SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. The paper thereby reframes recent measurement and reporting challenges as outcomes of conceptual conflicts between the technicist emphasis of divisions within the United Nations and the truth claims enshrined in intergovernmental agreements.

Regional Fisheries Organizations (RFOs) play a key role in managing fisheries on the high seas and therefore are vital for supporting the successful implementation of SDG 14. SDG 14 is intrinsically linked with SDG 13 (the need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). As biophysical impacts arise from human-induced climate change affect oceans, and fisheries therein, it is important that RFOs take account of such impacts on the management of fisheries. This paper examines the engagement of RFOs with SDG 14 and climate change through an analysis of interviews with 36 RFO stakeholders. The results show that even though there is consensus concerning the importance of climate change and SDG 14, most of the RFOs are not directly engaging with these two SDGs. However, it was stated that the work done by RFOs, to end overfishing, positively contributes to the realization of climate change and SDG 14, although the actions taken by RFOs need to increase in scale and speed if they are to fulfil their responsibility to effectively manage human impacts on ocean resources. Furthermore, member countries play a key role in supporting or resisting progress.

SDG 13 “take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impacts” calls for enhancing the adaptive capacity and build resilience to climate change as well as mainstreaming climate change measures into policies and planning processes of the countries. According to the IPCC assessment, Near East North Africa is one of the world regions that are most vulnerable to climatic change and consequently, agriculture is the most affected sector. It is anticipated that such a climate change impact would reduce crop yield up to 30%. Within the ‘Regional Initiative for the Assessment of the Impact of Climate Change on Water Resources and Socio-Economic Vulnerability in the Arab Region’ (RICCAR), the impact of climate change on specific agriculture sectors was projected using the two considered climate scenarios, based on selected Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), specifically RCP 4.5 (moderate-case scenario) and RCP 8.5 (worst-case scenario). Based on the RICCARD projections, the vulnerability of the agricultural sectors in the Arab Region to climate change have few aspects. Environmental challenges in the Arab world include water scarcity, with the lowest freshwater resource endowment in the world and very low precipitation with excessive exposure to extreme events. The Arab Region is one of the most impacted regions by climate change with half of its area’s cropland systems producing wheat, maize, olives, potatoes, olives and vegetables are considered high vulnerable to climate change. Livestock production as well is expected to decline due to drought, increase in degradation of rangelands and desertification. Expected more drought cycles in addition to increasing deforestation rate add to the challenges facing the forestry sector in the region. Egypt is considered as one of the countries that are greatly impacted by the climate change. The vulnerability of Egypt to climate change is significant in all agriculture sectors: cropping, fishery and livestock. Developing strategy to enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change in Egypt requires coordination and integration between the main related national strategies such as Egypt’s Vision 2030 [1], the Sustainable Agricultural Development Strategy [2], and Egypt’s National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction [3]. Climate change adaptation is of paramount importance to agriculture, given the reliance of the sector on climate. Climate change adaptation policies should be based on science, and incorporate knowledge of indigenous peoples and traditional practices.","Adaptive Capacity; Agricultural Production In Egypt; Resilience To Climate Change; Vulnerability","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119247891"

The solution is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) executed on a resource constrained low cost embedded micro controller integrated into a sensing unit very close to the microphone. The prototype operates without the need of being connected to a remote server through an always-on connectivity. The adoption of an on-the-edge artificial intelligence architecture brings a set of advantages: safety, reliability, promptness and low power consumption. The embedded intelligence is trained from a purpose-built dataset enclosing environmental car engine sound data. A pre trained ANN classifies sound events and counts cars approaching and leaving the microphone by sensing the Doppler Effects in the sound emitted by the moving vehicles. The results showed in this paper refer to the application running on the Sensortile Development Kit board from STMicroelectronics, featuring 128KB of RAM and 1MB of Flash memory. The development of the proposed solution was somehow inspired by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda defines a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It does so by defining 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to enable the transformation into a more peaceful and free society. Among them, the ones which interested the authors to develop the proposed solution were the following; Goal 3: 'Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages' Goal 11: 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable' Goal 13: 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts'.","Artificial Neural Networks; Embedded Systems; Intelligent Monitoring Of Vehicles; Sound Event Classification; Stm32; Traffic Optimization; Automobile Engines; Climate Change; Embedded Systems; Flash Memory; Microphones; Neural Networks; Planning; Random Access Storage; Traffic Control; Embedded Intelligence; Environmental Intelligence; Intelligent Monitoring; Low-power Consumption; Sound Event Classification; Stm32; Traffic Optimization; Urban Traffic Management; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075631825"

This indifference might be debated upon as the recent times has seen ever-growing concerns to address the crisis at hand, but this is no more than burning the night oil for a saving grace. If we look back, then it will not be difficult to analyze that the exploitation of the resources and the processes of degradation accelerated from the era of Industrial Revolution, dating back to 1750, but it took us more than a century to feel the repercussions of our actions. The first time ever the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" was addressed as an internal issue of concern was in the Rio Summit, held in Rio-de-Janeiro in Brazil in 1992. Since then, the world has witnessed a series of environmental protocols, treaties and summits, each one raising a doubt on the validity and effectiveness of the previous. Meanwhile, the ever-impending population surge has compounded the environmental stresses. To combat the changes we are introducing in our ecosystem, the research focuses on implementation of minor and doable actions in the mundane yet regular activities of our daily life, which have a direct impact on individual carbon footprint. The research establishes the success of these measures in Xavier Institute of Development Action and Studies (XIDAS) by comparing the scenarios before and after implementation of a ""Green Lifestyle"", which will help us achieve sustainability beyond environment protocols and beyond international treaties.","Carbon Footprint; Global Warming; Daily Lives; Direct Impact; Environmental Stress; Industrial Revolutions; International Treaties; Renewable Energies; Research Focus; United Nations; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047774362"

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals reinforce its current priorities in this regard (e.g. SDG 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts) and is one of the five priority areas of the Strategy 2020 of the European Commission. This chapter discusses the specificities of climate change online learning in respect to syllabus contents and highlights its multidisciplinary and multicultural components. One of the characteristics of online learning is its capacity to reach an extensive number of people, scattered around the world and with diversified cultural backgrounds. This opens an extremely valuable path to research and societal responsibility, filled with potentialities and challenges. Student’s cultural diversity and geographical belonging must be reflected in the syllabus contents, as well as in the objectives of the courses and in the competencies that should be promoted. Furthermore in the design of the courses it is increasingly relevant to reflect and value an interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning, because it is a key factor in Climate Change Education and Awareness. In this interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary dialog, it is crucial to evidence the cultural and contextual validity of knowledge and the impact of socioenvironmental dimensions in the configuration of Climate change challenges. For the purpose of this study we took as an example two course proposals: “Environment, Health and Wellbeing” for social sciences undergraduate students and “Governance of Climate Change Adaptation” for postgraduate students, presenting teaching contents, teaching and learning methodologies, effectiveness through e-learning in higher education institutions (HEIs) and the potential for increase in public climate science literacy.","Climate Change; Climate Science Literacy; Online Teaching; Societal Challenges","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071420783"

The framework can be used to apply exergy-based indicators for pinpointing the hotspots in food production chains where the irreversible consumption of natural resources is substantial, and for comparing the resource use efficiency of different system designs and configurations. Furthermore, we list a number of other exergy-based methodologies that are also of relevance in resource use efficiency assessment because they capture additional aspects (such as economic performance which exergy analysis alone cannot address) and with the potential of being integrated in this (or a different) framework.
