Much of previous research into entrepreneurship education in Africa has focused on universities. However, many potential African entrepreneurs do not have access to university education. To address this gap, findings are reported here from an Africa–Europe action research project with entrepreneurship centres and innovation organizations. This transnational entrepreneurship education (TNEE) project encompassed four stages of the entrepreneurial lifecycle: development of basic skills for entrepreneurship, business concept ideation, startups, and company growth. Here, details are provided of the entrepreneurship education programmes that were developed and delivered for each of these four stages. Through stage-specific actions, TNEE engaged learners from several African countries. Findings indicate that a wide range of learners, including unemployed youths who have limited Internet access, can be engaged in entrepreneurship education. In addition, findings indicate that education in entrepreneurial skills is important at the beginning of the entrepreneurial lifecycle but transfer of technological knowledge can be more important later in the entrepreneurial lifecycle. Furthermore, innovation organizations from outside of Africa can support African entrepreneurship centres with the transfer of technological knowledge to entrepreneurs. However, this is only useful if the technological knowledge of innovation organizations is not restricted to research but also extends to technology implementations in practice.","Africa–europe Collaboration; Engagement; Transnational Entrepreneurship Education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006412471"

The report issued by the UN in 2022 highlighted that the global education crisis for vulnerable groups has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, war, lack of infrastructure, and little or no psychosocial support. The prevalence of English as the medium of instruction in higher education, is a challenge for students who speak English as a second language. In South Africa, and Africa as a whole, the majority of the population speak in their mother tongue as a first language, which is problematic for students enrolled at English medium universities. This study focuses on accounting education from a South African perspective. Earlier research found that the number of African chartered accountants in South Africa are inadequately represented and cited one of the reasons as being a language barrier. We propose that the translation of accounting concepts into indigenous African languages can improve the understanding of accounting principles which will allow for inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all. In doing so, we develop a prototype application, which encompasses augmented reality and artificial intelligence-generated language translation functionalities to teach accounting principles in an indigenous African language, namely, IsiZulu. The application, named Zulu Augmented Reality Translation (ZART), aids the learning process of accounting principles, by providing an engaging and interactive learning experience in IsiZulu. The paper commences with a literature review on the teaching pedagogy and challenges in accounting education. Thereafter, the design science research applied in the development of ZART is discussed. Using questionnaires, an experiment is conducted to evaluate the usability of ZART, students’ perceptions and pedagogical experiences of using ZART. The results of the evaluation show that ZART was easy to install and use; students were captivated with the avatars in ZART; and the language translation functionality was useful for learning the basics of accounting. ZART is of importance to policy makers and standard setters in the accounting profession, accounting academics, and accounting students. This study provides a platform for the translation of the accounting curriculum into numerous indigenous African languages.","Accounting Education; Artificial Intelligence-generated Language Translations; Augmented Reality; Design Science Research; Isizulu; Sustainable Development Goal 4","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216875450"

Education can only unfold its full potential to transform our world if it is approached from a lifelong learning perspective. In this way, learners' lives are brought closer to education through integrated, multi-sectoral approaches that draw the focus from supply to demand. In order to achieve this, institutions and educators need to come up with strategies that are inclusive regardless of the student's intellectual challenges, physical stature, gender, language, culture, or mode of learning. Enablers, Barriers, and Challenges for Inclusive Curriculum examines the impact of enablers and barriers on education for students and teachers. It discusses promoting inclusive curriculum in face-to-face, online, and blended learning environments.

The study aims to examine the strategies employed by the government to enhance secondary education, pinpoint the prevailing challenges, and evaluate their alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG-4, “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”). A survey was conducted with respondents comprising 300 teachers and administrators from 100 public secondary schools. This data was supplemented by 15 in-depth interviews with policymakers and educational experts. The quantitative analysis indicates a strong positive correlation between government policies and student outcomes, with a correlation coefficient of 0.60. Moreover, teacher training was found to significantly impact education quality, with a correlation coefficient of 0.70. The qualitative analysis uncovered critical barriers in policy implementation and unequal resource distribution, particularly in rural areas. It is important to note that these findings are based on respondents' perceptions and do not confirm direct causal relationships between the variables. The study concludes that while Pakistan has made progress in educational reform, there is a pressing need for improved implementation, fair resource distribution, and enhanced teacher training to achieve SDG-4 and ensure affordable, high-quality secondary education. These insights offer a perception-based understanding of challenges and priorities that can inform future policy discussions and empirical investigations.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007299810"

With over 122.6 million people worldwide forcibly displaced, and the number of refugees globally reaching 43.7 million by mid-2024, focusing on the importance of refugees accessing lifelong learning has become more urgent than ever. Despite this, refugees have been excluded from SDG-related national development plans, monitoring and reporting, raising questions about how the targets agreed in the Global Compact on Refugees and the SDGs are being implemented and met. Education, migration regulation and border regimes that reproduce injustices are fundamental elements of colonial education and have implications for lifelong learning. Education is often presented as crucial to the “integration” of migrants, including refugee people who have come to England. Nevertheless, the British government’s austerity policies, regarded by some as a form of racism, have underfunded the education system. This has made it more challenging for all learners from low-income families, and specifically refugee people, to access adequate education, amongst other rights. This article begins with a look at the assimilationist and apparent neutrality of approaches to education as sponsored by global and national commitments. The author then briefly discusses education as a practice of oppression, with colonial implications, including presenting perspectives from England and Brasil drawn from qualitative and mixed-methods doctoral and postdoctoral research. The article concludes by proposing approaches to enact education and lifelong learning as a practice of liberation rooted in critical, anti-racist and anti-colonial thinking and praxis.","Anti-colonialism; Education; Lifelong Learning; Migration; Refugees; Sdgs; Colonialism; Education; Refugee; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; England; United Kingdom","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000323330"

Furthermore, their vulnerability has been exacerbated by the fact that they are not visible to proponents for the rights of the women as well as the disability rights. They are more prone to violence, abuse, poverty, and exclusion from society. The economic, social as well as political opportunities available to them are limited. Girls and women with disability not only experience discrimination in family life but also in education and the workplace. It is crucial to establish an inclusive atmosphere that is supportive of women and girls who have any disability to ensure that they have equitable opportunities to engage in all spheres of life. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in general, and Goal 5, in particular, emphasise to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” Highlighting the current scenario of females with disabilities, the chapter discusses interventions and strategies for empowering women and girls with disabilities through legal framework and human rights both at the national and international levels. Some inspirational life stories of women with different abilities are also shared for making a difference in their own lives and in turn the lives of others.","Empowerment; Intersectionality; Interventions; Success Stories; Women And Girls With Disability","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006977793"

Concurrently, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), acid reflux, and functional dyspepsia, are frequently reported in this population. Objective: this review article aims to synthesize the existing evidence on the relationship between burnout and GI symptoms among healthcare providers, which help to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being (Goal-3 in SDGs). Results: after a comprehensive search of recent articles, the findings suggest a significant bidirectional relationship between burnout and GI symptoms, with chronic stress and dysregulation of the gut-brain axis playing key roles. Interventions targeting stress reduction and organisational changes may mitigate both burnout and GI symptoms. Further research studies are needed to establish causality and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted interventions. Also, there is a need to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for healthcare providers to maintain wellbeing. ‎ Conclusions: the relationship between burnout and GI symptoms among healthcare providers is complex and bidirectional. Chronic stress associated with burnout can lead to the development or exacerbation of GI symptoms, while the presence of GI symptoms can contribute to burnout.","Burnout; Gastrointestinal Symptoms; Good Health And Wellbeing; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs)","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006521308"

They are essential for fostering nation-building, creating an egalitarian society, and achieving human potential. They are important tools that equip individuals with the necessary skill and knowledge to comprehend their rights and responsibilities toward the society. Moreover, a country adopts an education policy based on its culture, tradition, and societal views. The National Education Policy 2020, which came after 34 years, is aligned with this need and has a holistic approach toward disseminating knowledge. Its goal is to shift the education system from being focused on teachers toward students, from being centered around information toward knowledge, from prioritizing marks toward skills, from examinations towards experiments, from being centered around learning to research, and from being choice-driven to being competency-driven. SDG 4, which aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities to all by 2030,” is notably related with NEP 2020. In this backdrop, the present chapter navigates through India’s journey on the path to attain Gross Enrollment Ratio in education, self-dependence, empowerment, prosperity, and nation-building through the lens of NEP and SDGs. It discusses different perspectives on education and critically examines the origin, evolution, and contours of education in India through the lens of reports of various commissions and government initiatives.

Researchers conducted a survey using structured questionnaires among 368 university students from three universities in Jiangxi Province. They measured their self-reported responses on six constructs: perceived educational support, perceived emotional support, perceived usefulness, confirmation, satisfaction, and continuance intention. The relationships between predictors and continuance intention, characterized by non-compensatory and non-linear dynamics, were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling combined with Artificial Neural Networks. Apart from the direct effects of perceived educational and emotional support on perceived usefulness being non-significant, all other hypotheses were confirmed. Furthermore, according to the normalized importance derived from the multilayer perceptron analysis, satisfaction was identified as the most critical predictor (100%), followed by confirmation (29.9%), perceived usefulness (28.3%), perceived educational support (22.6%), and perceived emotional support (21.6%). These constructs explained 62.1% of the total variance in the students’ continuance intention to engage in e-learning.

Articles published in English between January 2000 and October 2022 that reported on the association between parental education and ECC were screened, and the extracted data were compiled, summarized, and synthesized. Review papers and non-primary quantitative research papers were excluded from the full-text review. Open coding was applied to develop a conceptual framework. Results: In total, 49 studies were included: 42 cross-sectional, 3 case-control and 4 cohort studies. The majority (91.8%) reported on the associations between ECC and maternal (n = 33), paternal (n = 3), and parental (n = 9) level of education, and 13 (26.7%) reported on the association between parental education and the severity of ECC. Mothers with more than primary school education (n = 3), post-secondary/college/tertiary education (n = 23), and more than 4–12 years of education (n = 12) had children with lower risk for ECC. Two studies reporting on parental education found an association between maternal but not paternal education and ECC. The review suggests that achieving the SDG 4.1 may reduce the risk of ECC. Possible pathways by which maternal education protects from ECC were feeding practices, oral hygiene practices, and the use of dental services. Conclusion: The study findings suggests that higher maternal educational level may reduce the risk for the consumption of cariogenic diet, poor oral hygiene practices and poor use of dental services for caries prevention. However, the association between paternal education and ECC was not consistently observed, with significant associations less frequently reported compared to maternal education. Future studies are needed to define the magnitude and modifiers of the impact of maternal education on the risk for ECC.","Early Childhood Caries; Feeding Behaviors; Maternal Education; Oral Hygiene Practices, Dental Care; Paternal Education; Child; Child Parent Relation; Dental Caries; Education; Educational Status; Human; Preschool Child; Prevalence; Sustainable Development; Child; Child, Preschool; Dental Caries; Educational Status; Humans; Parents; Prevalence; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192018608"

Achieving this requires contextualized approaches to accommodate diverse global values and promote learning opportunities that best meet the needs and goals of all learners as individuals and members of different communities. Advances in learning analytics (LA), natural language processes (NLP), and artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI technologies, offer potential to aid educational decision making by supporting analytic insights and personalized recommendations. However, these technologies also raise serious risks for reinforcing or exacerbating existing inequalities; these dangers arise from multiple factors including biases represented in training datasets, the technologies' abilities to take autonomous decisions, and processes for tool development that do not centre the needs and concerns of historically marginalized groups. To ensure that Educational Decision Support Systems (EDSS), particularly AI-powered ones, are equipped to promote equity, they must be created and evaluated holistically, considering their potential for both targeted and systemic impacts on all learners, especially members of historically marginalized groups. Adopting a socio-technical and cultural perspective is crucial for designing, deploying, and evaluating AI-EDSS that truly advance educational equity and inclusion. This editorial introduces the contributions of five papers for the special section on advancing equity and inclusion in educational practices with AI-EDSS. These papers focus on (i) a review of biases in large language models (LLMs) applications offers practical guidelines for their evaluation to promote educational equity, (ii) techniques to mitigate disparities across countries and languages in LLMs representation of educationally relevant knowledge, (iii) implementing equitable and intersectionality-aware machine learning applications in education, (iv) introducing a LA dashboard that aims to promote institutional equality, diversity, and inclusion, and (v) vulnerable student digital well-being in AI-EDSS. Together, these contributions underscore the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in developing and utilizing AI-EDSS to not only foster a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape worldwide but also reveal a critical need for a broader contextualization of equity that incorporates the socio-technical questions of what kinds of decisions AI is being used to support, for what purposes, and whose goals are prioritized in this process.","Ai; Ai-edss; Bias; Education; Equality; Inclusion","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198137990"

This research was carried out with 315 students from Catalan public universities through a questionnaire to assess their perception of these competencies. The results show that competences related to leadership in educational environments, inclusive values, or the identification of the students’ abilities are being developed in internship centres. However, the university classroom context lead to the development of competences related to cooperative learning and assessment. In addition, there are significant differences between students who follow specialised teacher training in special needs and those who do not follow it.

While it is not a new notion, its significance has become more apparent in recent years. Interdisciplinary approaches offer numerous advantages in the workplace, including collaboration, communication, research, flexibility, interpersonal skills, and other multidisciplinary abilities that are highly sought after today. Education plays a key role in society and has a significant impact on a country’s overall socioeconomic growth. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) set time-bound targets for various sectors crucial to development, such as health, education, employment, sanitation, energy, infrastructure, and the environment. From a global perspective, India’s achievement of these goals is crucial. The importance of inclusion and high-quality education for all is reaffirmed. Providing quality education for everyone emphasizes the idea that sustainable development is a proven and powerful tool in achieving education for all. This chapter aims to provide insights into the evolution of interdisciplinary concepts in management education (ME) over time. The SDGs mandate that governments ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all children and adults, as well as lifelong learning opportunities. This, combined with providing access, aims to promote equity, inclusiveness, and sustainable education. Therefore, the objective of this chapter is to study the SDGs in the Indian context and examine how they are integrated with ME. It examines the status of goal attainment in education in India at various levels, including primary, secondary, and tertiary, and seeks to identify some of the major challenges faced by the education sector in providing quality education and addressing accessibility issues.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208904699"

While SDG 4 seeks to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”, most member states, particularly developing countries like South Africa are faced with the challenge of addressing one of the targets of SDG 4, which is ensuring “that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy” by 2030. In ensuring a substantial proportion of adults achieving numeracy by 2030, this research addresses SDG 4 by examining pre-service teachers’ prior mathematical cognition, ease of learning (fluency), mathematics concepts acquisition and inappropriate instruction as predictors of quality educational performance in South Africa. As with fluency, how past underperformance in primary school due to poor instruction influenced current underperformance in higher education remains a point for debate. Against the backdrop of ensuring a substantial proportion of adults achieving numeracy, the study administered 71 structured questionnaires to rural school learners. At p<0.05, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that the underperformance of learners in numeracy at primary schools is associated with inappropriate preparatory practices, as well as poor mathematical cognition in their higher education. Learners’ performance at their various educational levels is significantly dependent on their prior mathematical skills at primary schools.","Educational Level; Learners; Mathematical Cognition; Performance; Quality Education; Sdg 4; Sustainability","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200484983"

This chapter aims to show that inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning are only possible when education responds to and reflects the multilingual nature of a society. Focusing on ASEAN, this study examines multilingualism and the extent to which development of multilingual and multiliteracies' competency is given a place in the education system. Cross-border mobility and increased ASEAN cooperation have led to a transition from specific languages and cultures to a mixture of the same in nations in the region. To add to this complexity, English was declared ASEAN's sole working language, a status confirmed in its 2009 Charter. ASEAN member states would have to reexamine their language education policies to allow for multilingualism and respect for mother tongues. The one-nation-one-language ideology and the promotion of single languages as national languages, together with the pragmatic rationale for language learning that prioritizes English, conflict with actual multilingual realities.

Transformative leadership goes well beyond traditional technical and rational approaches to leadership; it includes but extends theories such as social justice leadership and transformational leadership and involves two general principles and eight interconnected tenets. These include knowing oneself, one's community and organization; deconstructing frameworks that perpetuate inequity and re-constructing them in more equitable ways; addressing the inequitable distribution of power; emphasizing individual and collective good; focusing on democracy emancipation, equity, and justice as well as interconnectedness and global awareness; and offering both critique and promise. Transformative leadership theory is a critical, holistic, and normative approach that focuses on values, and on beliefs and mindsets as well as knowledge and action. It is characterized by its activist agenda and its overriding commitment to social justice, equity, and democratic society. Thus, it is an approach to leadership that is anti-racist, anti-homophobic, anti-xenophobic, etc.; it calls for rejection of deficit thinking and for inclusive and equitable practices that require moral courage.

Highlighting thereby that it is not enough that one knows the applicable law, it is equally (if not more) important that the way the legal logic is communicated to the judge. This is especially true for common law countries like India following an adversarial legal system. Because in adversarial legal systems, judges play a passive role and either accept or reject a presented submission. This gives a general impression that it is not the truth but the best lawyer who wins the case. The question that largely remains for us here is whether the great lawyers are a result of formal education or self-education. According to Indian National Education Policy, 2020, holistic education focuses on developing all capacities of human beings -intellectual, aesthetic, social, physical, emotional, and moral. In a 'great lawyer', one would find a seamless combination of these capabilities. Internationally, UNICEF has defined life skills as ""a behavior change or behavior development approach designed to address a balance of three areas: knowledge, attitude, and skills."" The present UN Sustainable Development Goal 4., ""Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for a manifestation of realization that formal education is incomplete without life-skills."" In this chapter, the authors intend to evaluate generally the current National Education Policy, 2020 on higher education and to evaluate particularly the Bar Council of India Rules of Legal Education - 2008 (along with considering the Draft Bar Council of India Rules of Legal Education - 2019) alongside the philosophy behind life skills' courses. The two key expected outcomes of this article are: 1) Underlining the shift in the purpose of legal education from providing a living to law professionals as life-long learners, selfsufficient and relevant to the changing socio-economic and technolegal demands of the increasingly globalizing world; 2) Highlighting the changed focus of regulatory guidelines on Indian legal education along with the national education policy contributing to the development of life skills in law professionals. The authors will be using doctrinal research methodology in analysing the secondary research material.","Higher Education In India; Indian Legal Education; Life Skills; National Education Policy; Skills For Lawyers/law Professionals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159887238"

The pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities and changed how education functions, moving to online and hybrid methods. The challenges in global education highlighted and worsened by the pandemic make it necessary to re-evaluate education systems and the policies in place to support access, quality and equal opportunity. This article focuses on analysing education policies at a national level. It tests a pilot policy analysis tool, the International Education Index (IEI), developed as a starting point to begin this reconsideration and create an accessible and comprehensive way to evaluate national education systems to inform decision-making and policies in the new context. This research uses Ireland and Northern Ireland to test the IEI pilot tool. The IEI consists of 54 questions across nine indicators, including institutional frameworks, education strategies, digital skills and infrastructure, twenty-first century skills, access to basic social services, adherence to international standards, legal frameworks, data gathering and availability and international partnerships. Countries can score 108 points to be categorised as having developed, emerging or nascent national education systems. Ireland scored 94 and Northern Ireland 81, indicating that they have developed national education systems.","Change And Sustainability; Covid-19; Education Policy; Policy Analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144678068"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes two outreach programs of Brazilian universities: the Welcome Program for Immigrants (Programa Acolhida ao Imigrante) of the University of South Santa Catarina, a private higher education institution and the Support Center for Immigrants and Refugees (Núcleo de Apoio ao Imigrantes e Refugiados), sponsored by the Federal University of Santa Catarina, a public university. The activities of the two institutions were compared with the targets of the sustainable development goals to discuss the outreach strategies of HEIs aimed at promoting the inclusion of refugees, through descriptive research, with a qualitative approach based on documentary and bibliographic research. Findings: The results show that academic participation in research and outreach programs provides refugees with an education but also represents a social contribution far beyond qualifications and technical training, by mitigating local and global problems. The practice of inclusive education allows a reduction in historically existing inequalities. The findings of this study indicate that the results are much more effective when universities, government and society work together to reduce inequalities. Originality/value: This study addressed how universities can and should ensure life quality (SDG 3), including an equitable education and fostering lifelong learning opportunities for everybody (SDG 4) and gender equality (SDG 5), to reduce unemployment (SDG 8) and inequalities among people (SDG 10), through outreach projects.","Decent Work; Gender Equality; Inclusion; Life Quality; Reduction Of Inequalities; Refugees; Sustainable Development Goals; University","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139509161"

Digital divide, gender inequality, addressing specially-abled students, and a non-inclusive learning environment are the major barriers to inclusive education. Inclusive education ensures that ‘no one leaves behind’, and higher education institutes can enhance their capacity building to promote inclusivity for the common good. Employability is one of the key concepts in higher education that builds the workforce and contributes to nation-building.

However, available literature shows that such children and youth face bullying in schools and are excluded by their teachers and peers because they are or are perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) or questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI). Schools that are not safe or inclusive for learners violate the right to education as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and act as barriers to SDG 4 (ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) and SDG 5 (gender equality). Research on bullying and violence in schools is critical for making institutions safe and welcoming for all students. Using empirical data from sexual and gender minority adolescents/youth, the authors highlight the various forms and the magnitude of SOGI-related bullying in educational settings and the availability and use of current redressal mechanisms. The authors also suggest mechanisms to be put in place to prevent and mitigate bullying, including the implementation of anti-bullying policies, awareness generation among students and teachers on diversity in gender and sexuality, establishing support systems for reporting bullying, and providing supportive counseling services for victims of bullying. They emphasize that educational institutions should be inclusive of people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities—a key to achieving SDG 5—gender equality.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195277745"

The UNs Sustainable Development Goals establish specific requirements for increasing educational quality and protecting the well-being of children. UN’s agenda for Sustainable Development Goal 4 which aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” was adopted in India in 2015. Students’ academic success is a vital part of the education system. Predicting student performance has grown more challenging due to the enormous amount of data in educational databases. Low-performing students will experience a variety of difficulties, including delayed graduation and even dropping out. Therefore, educational institutions should closely monitor the academic progress of their students and provide quick assistance to those who have low performance. Using Students’ academic achievement predictions to accomplish that is one method. This method will help educational institutions in identifying and supporting low-performing students at an initial stage. This study presents a systematic review of research on sentiment analysis towards SDG4 quality education through social media platform such as Twitter, Facebook and a review of 21 studies indexed in SCOPUS. Using social media data rather than a conventional survey of the data, evaluation of outspoken opinion and feelings of students towards their institution to obtain Quality Education. In this study, the dataset is taken from kaggle with names as student-performance-data-set which uses two files named as student-math, and student-por which shows the student performance in a Math language course and Portuguese language course, respectively, with 33 attributes and 396 records in each. Of 396 records, 110 records were selected as sample. During the visualization, we analyzed SVM model is stable because even minor data changes have no impact on the hyperplane and it handles the nonlinear data using Kernel techniques.","Quality Education; Sdgs; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138305870"

Furthermore, the sufficiency and/or shortage of elementary and middle schools according to the criteria of the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs (MOMRA) were studied to establish the regions with shortage or overcapacity. The findings reveal that the city’s population and public elementary and middle school numbers were not spread equally. Some districts had an overabundance and concentration of elementary and middle schools, particularly in older, fully developed, and densely inhabited districts, while most new north and eastern districts had a scarcity of schools. Furthermore, half of the districts lack public elementary and middle schools.

Other insufficiently addressed issues comprise actions to in-clude students with intellectual disability in university classrooms, and the awareness-raising and sensitisation of undergraduate students regarding disability. These deficiencies persist despite the known benefits of these types of initiatives for all the agents involved. For this reason, we carried out an inclusive experience at the Pablo de Olavide University, specifically in the statistics subject. Educational resources were adapted, inclusion activities were conducted with students with intellectual disability, and we were in charge of awareness-raising and sensitisation of undergraduate students. The present paper describes the experience as well as its evaluation, which was performed using a survey. Furthermore, the work compares the achievement of students with a more engaging system that incorporates inclusive teaching versus one that does not. The results, which were statis-tically analysed, report high levels of satisfaction for all the involved agents, as well as improve-ments in the academic performance of the students.

While a range of industry-school partnerships exist, examples of successful models that might inform practice are scarce. This article describes an investigation into how industry professionals, university educators, teachers, and students success-fully implemented a STEM education experience (Girls as Leaders in STEM (GALS)). Formative and summative evaluation processes were used to generate data through a co-design research approach to describe and measure changes in student practices, attitudes, and engagement in relation to STEM and leadership as a result of connecting to industry problems. This research focused on the analysis of teacher and student interview data generated upon the completion of the program, which provided feedback on the different aspects of the process and, in particular, the role of industry in relation to the girls’ attitudes. This research highlights the benefits of industry involvement with girls in terms of their engagement with STEM, the authenticity of STEM learning, and the novelty of the learning experience. These benefits are discussed with respect to how they can raise girls’ STEM aspirations and ensure equitable educational opportunities—aligning with SDG4.","Career Aspirations; Engagement; Girls In Stem; Industry Partnerships; Design; Education; Gender Role; Learning; Participatory Approach; Research Work; Strategic Approach; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129182817"

Therefore, the Palestinian Government seeks to develop educational practices to adapt to the needs of all students, including gifted children. Consequently, the identification of gifted pre-school children in Palestine aims to better include them in the general education curriculum. The current study aims to investigate the characteristics of gifted children through the perceptions of the pre-school teachers in Palestine. A mixed-methods approach was adopted. The quantitative data were collected by the “Scale for Rating the Behavioral Characteristics of Gifted and Talented Students”. The pre-school teachers in the sample were randomly selected, consisting of 450 female pre-school teachers. The qualitative data were collected by semi-structured interview, which 15 female pre-school teachers took part in. There was a significant difference in teachers’ perceptions according to their academic qualifications, and according to whether gifted children need a particular curriculum or not, but there was no significant difference in teachers’ perceptions according to their experiences. The final result shows that there were many positive perceptions regarding the characteristics of gifted children through qualitative data. Therefore, there was consistency between the qualitative and quantitative data of the study.

One of the frameworks for SDG 4 is to propose the concepts of “equitable quality education”. To attain and work in the context of SDG 4, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming technology, which is gaining interest in understanding student behavior and assessing student performance. AI holds great potential for improving education as it has started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in education to create better learning. To provide better education, data analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid solutions with high accuracy. This paper presents an AI-based analytics tool created to predict student performance in a first-year Information Technology literacy course at The University of the South Pacific (USP). A Random Forest based classification model was developed which predicted the performance of the student in week 6 with an accuracy value of 97.03%, sensitivity value of 95.26%, specificity value of 98.8%, precision value of 98.86%, Matthews correlation coefficient value of 94% and Area Under the ROC Curve value of 99%. Hence, such a method is very useful in predicting student performance early in their courses of allowing for early intervention. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested prediction model satisfies the required accuracy, precision, and recall factors for forecasting the behavioural elements of teaching and e-learning for students in virtual education systems.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Classification; Early Warning System; Higher Education Institutions; Machine Learning; Sdgs; Student Performance Prediction; Artificial Intelligence; Covid-19; Higher Education; Institutional Framework; Learning; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Student; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; University Sector","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125111843"

However, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), despite the international commitment to Occupational Health and Safety (OSH) via the 2030’s Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), work-related accidents are still far too common. Work-related mortality accounts for 5% of all deaths worldwide; a toll which has increased dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, in the context of COVID-19, new demands on the labour market, such as teleworking, adequate protective measures, and proper use of personal protective equipment when physical presence cannot be avoided, are necessitating new approaches to ensure health and safety. Arguably, education can be viewed as a cross-cutting strategy in advance of a culture of safety for future generations, through strengthening skills and broadening knowledge. Indeed, even though education cannot be considered a panacea, related to SDG 4, which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, it can be considered a critical component to deal with OSH issues using a preventive, rather than a reactive, approach. Given this fact, European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) has stressed the prevention approach through mainstreaming OSH in education at all levels, and in all fields of vocational and academic training. Aware of the potential of universities to provide graduates the broad-based knowledge to produce labour-market skills including OSH, the aim of this study is to contribute to the discussion on mainstreaming OSH into Greek university education, using Harokopio University (HUA) as a case study. For this purpose, a web-based survey was conducted to address HUA’s students, faculty members, and staff OSH knowledge, risks awareness, and attitudes, as well as their perceptions, opinions, and beliefs about the role of OSH for academia. A statistical analysis depicted respondents’ high level of willingness to contribute to the promotion of OSH, while additional evidence suggests a considerable commitment of the respondents to participate in HUA’s OSH-related training and education.","2030 Agenda; Education; Higher Education; Occupational Safety And Health; Sdgs; Sustainable Development; Training; Covid-19; Higher Education; Learning; Mortality; Statistical Analysis; Sustainable Development; Training","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125068605"

In this chapter we elaborate and reflect on the concept of quality education with respect to different education models and re-visit quality, not only in terms of measurable, quantitative outcomes but qualitative, subtle elements of quality in education. These elements can be sought within the context of education, the competences it is expected to deliver, appropriate pedagogies, its effectiveness and relevance and most importantly reflexivity and sustainability. Integrated in a competence-based ESD, ‘qualitative elements’ can ensure a deeper form of quality aligned to the humanistic education paradigm and values-based critical pedagogy. In this context we critically scrutinize an international model for competence-based ESD and discuss how such models can contribute to quality education.","Competence Models; Deep Quality Education; Education For Sustainable Development (esd); Esd Competences; Quality Education","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187022802"

It is perhaps fair to argue that there are more understandings of the factors that place children and youth at the risk of marginalization than the definitions of the term itself. The 2010 global education monitoring report focused on the issue of marginalization. It was noted that “the new deprivation and marginalization in education data set highlights the level of exclusion in 80 countries”.

Some scholars go as far as to say that it is broken. This was also noted when the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, linked to the Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, were developed. One of the goals was defined as to ‘Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’. This article explores the important role of education in transforming societies. To achieve this objective, the research in this article is based on a qualitative literature search. It focuses on relevant literature that included books, scholarly articles, online articles and scientific data provided by Statistics South Africa. It starts off by describing the brokenness of education in South Africa through the latest statistics that provide a very dark picture of education in the country. In the second place, the article revisits the Reformation to indicate that the church can and is called to play an important role in the improvement of education. The article concludes with two examples of how church organisations and specific churches in South Africa take up the challenge to transform societies through specific educational programmes. Contribution: Specific mention is made of the programme of the South African Council of Churches called The South Africa We Pray For and Little Seeds, which is a combined programme in Early Childhood Development. As such, what happens in South Africa can be an example to the rest of Africa.","Church; Crisis; Early Childhood Development; Education; Poverty; Reformation; South Africa; The South Africa We Pray For","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140035233"

In modern society, the problem of inclusion is acute. There are two sides to this problem—how people with disabilities realize themselves in society, and how humanity relates to such people. One of the main tasks of SD Goal 4 “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” is to “build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all”. Nevertheless, inclusion is still a challenge in many social aspects, including in a university setting. Based on such challenges, the aim of this paper is to show how the inclusion problem is realized via specific actions, including unimpeded access to university buildings, audiences and computer classes; on-line teaching; availability of a site for people with poor eyesight; and access to teaching materials through an e-library. A case study is presented, showing how it supports the achievement this sustainable development at the Minsk Branch of Russian Plekhanov University of Economics.","Campus; Inclusive Education; Principles; Social Aspects; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133795465"

With regard to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, administrations must ensure inclusive, equitable and quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. One of the problems, that most affects to equal opportunities and the well-being of citizens, is school segregation. This article aims to describe the causes and effects of school segregation in the 21 educational cities of Spain from the perspective of municipal technicians and techniques that have participated in this study, offering proposals that redefine the problem in order to tackle it in a sustainable way. The approach used is descriptive-interpretative and the instruments deployed were an initial online questionnaire and written records derived from the implementation of the World Café. The analytical procedure consisted of ordering and making sense of the information through a categorical analysis.. The results addressed that the causes explaining school segregation, defined by the technicians, are closely related to socioeconomic, socio-cultural and housing factors (urban planning, family residence, income, family cultural level, proximity of the school), ethnic-cultural aspects (national origin, the tendency to group together due to community affinity) and education policy (treatment of the different educational networks, distribution of schools, functioning of schools, addressing diversity, equality of the education system, etc.). The sustainable approach to this problem requires the development of transversal policies, a high level of coordination between the various administrations (state, regional and local) and the responsibility and involvement of the political class.","Educating Cities; Equal Opportunities; School Segregation; Social Exclusion; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132771713"

The general aim is to support a reflective knowledge of mathematical concepts by implementing a digital educational device based on collaborative and dialogical activities proposed by researchers. Within a dialogical dimension of interactions (Bakhtin, 1981), argumentative practice is considered a social activity, where the acquisition and elaboration of new knowledge take place within a social space with multiple interlocutors in a dynamic process. The participants are engaged in constructing and negotiating mathematical meanings within a specific context. This dialogical approach to argumentation tends to create an authentic argumentative culture that is a system of implicit and explicit rules where the exchanges and interactions among participants require a joint elaboration of new meanings, within a given mathematical context, through a dialogical exchange. Learning and development result from a dialogical negotiation process during which new knowledge is developed and those already possessed are re-organized and systematized (Bakhtin, 1981; Vygotskij, 1978). In the current pandemic circumstances, technologies are the main tools to uphold the educational processes. Despite the fact that the DIST-M was implemented and tested before the Covid-19 era, its epistemic bases of dialogism mediated by technology could significantly keep alive the dialogic interaction in educational settings that have been heavily affected by the social distancing and promote mathematical thinking. The articles focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal n. 4,"" Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.","Argumentative Culture; Dialogical Interaction; Digital Interactive Storytelling; Mathematics; Technologies","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131095738"

In order to comprehensively shape environmental policy, it is important to understand the interactions between sustainable development goals (SDGs) as well as their impact on environmental goals. Employing econometric modeling based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method and full-factorial analysis, the authors identify a number of statistically significant relationships between the implementation of sustainable development goals and the environmental variable represented by greenhouse gas emissions. Analysis reveals that implementation of particular sustainable development goals, namely SDG4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities) and SDG17 (Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development), explicitly facilitate the achievement of environmental policies. In addition, other SDGs exert an indirect influence on environmental goals through their reinforcing interactions with SDG4 and SDG17 variables. These are: SDG1 (End poverty), SDG3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being), SDG8 (Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and productive employment) and SDG15 (Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests and halt biodiversity loss).

For example, during the period of COVID19, schools were closed with no option of online learning due to a deficit of infrastructure around educational technologies. Inequalities in digital access have impeded educational gains made towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Though significant studies have been carried out on digital learning, there is currently a dearth of knowledge on students' digital gaps and needs in remote communities in Nigeria. To this end, this research study explored the digital gaps and needs of rural secondary schools in remote communities and its implications on e-learning across 6 Nigerian states, namely Kwara, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Bayelsa, Adamawa, and Kano during the COVID19 era. The study adopted a concurrent embedded mixed method design approach to collect data from rural secondary schools from 6 Nigerian states. Findings from the study identified a lack of ICT strategies and policies in Nigeria, socioeconomic status, poor internet connectivity, electricity, and a high poverty level as the primary drivers of digital gaps in remote communities. Therefore, addressing the digital gaps among students in remote parts of Nigeria will be crucial to achieving the targets of SDGs, particularly SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all by 2030.","Covid19; Digital Gaps; Digital Needs; E-learning; Sdg4","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131543961"

Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” of the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (UN, Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, A/RES/70/1, 2015). To illustrate the positive impacts of the project, we use significant life narratives from the participants and we critically describe methodology and activities, which are a community-based participatory action research approach. The project gives a contribution in providing equal learning opportunities for the elderly, enhancing intergenerational learning and promoting awareness of the importance of learning at an advanced age and, as a consequence, demonstrating that, at this stage of life, educational offers are not an expense but an investment for social inclusion, active citizenship, well-being and happiness. In line with European efforts, Portugal has been active in pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, but the level of achievement is still far from expectations.

Moreover, within SDG 4, the global community has called for inclusive and equitable quality education and the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all. In both developed and developing countries, migrants and the displaced are in vulnerable situations. How to ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for them has become a priority for governments in both destination and origin areas.

In this article, I argue that the work of the comparative research community has the potential to inform and enrich UNESCO’s SDG 4 indicators agenda concerning teachers, but this would require moving from a focus on easy to measure indicators such as teacher qualifications to more meaningful and valid indicators such as teacher qualities, and the quality of their education–a neglected area in the SDG 4 targets.

As a mandate, Goal 4 of Sustainable Development Goals states that by 2030 all member states should work to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” (UNESCO, 2015). In practice, however, the responses of different international education institutions during the Covid-19 confinement indicate that the achievement of this equity plan at the global level is rather unfeasible. To address this issue from a local lens, this study seeks to examine the plan implemented for online teaching in the Algerian higher education institutions. It draws on a key body of literature on online infrastructure and pedagogy to explore (1) the different online teaching models that were implemented, (2) Algerian higher education teachers' practices within the framework of this new model of teaching, and (3) the different challenges encountered by teachers during this transition. To achieve this end, a qualitative study that is based on an analysis of teachers' interviews is conducted to explore teachers' practices in different higher education institutions in Algeria. The results of this research will not only highlight the prevailing disparities, but will also serve to offer recommendations that could be relevant to future teachers' professional development programs.","Algeria; Covid-19; Disparity; Infrastructure; Online Teaching","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101044269"

According to the Incheon Declaration and SDG 4 - Education 2030 Framework for Action (2015), the Quality Education goal: SDG 4, is proposed to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. E-learning, as a flexible learning pathway, enables the inclusion of diverse learners and improves the concept of lifelong learning. Recently, e-learning is becoming a critical strategy that increases the access opportunities for all people to higher education. Several research studies have been done on the benefits of e-learning in higher education, while others have reported many challenges affecting its successful and effective utilization, mostly related to quality assurance. Having the reported benefits, e-learning can be considered as an opportunity to achieve the sustainability of education, given the current huge shift to digital education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, higher education institutions need to ensure its effective utilization with proper quality assurance processes. A review of scientific papers has been conducted to serve the goal of this study paper. This study is of significance because it highlights the benefits and challenges of e-learning in the developing countries' higher education as well as presents examples of e-learning quality assurance models developed and implemented internationally, as solutions to overcome the challenges, all in one place which gives a holistic view of the topic.

The model aims to support analysis of the policy context and interactions between the structures and processes at different levels to ensure effective support for inclusive school leadership and development of appropriate competences. Key issues addressing competences for inclusive school leadership, support and professional development opportunities for inclusive school leaders and policy frameworks that support inclusive leadership across the whole education system are explored. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on a current Agency project, Supporting Inclusive School Leadership (SISL), a cross-national project that considers how best to ensure that school leaders meet the needs of all learners in their school communities. The SISL project examines current theories of school leadership together with the core functions of school leaders in participating countries in order to develop a model specifically focused on inclusive school leadership. Findings: Agency projects such as SISL focus on research findings and policy developments that support countries to chart their own course toward a common goal. This process of cross-national working permits member countries with their distinctive national, ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversities to work together on common goals. In this project an ecosystem model of inclusive education was adapted to reflect on the policy context needed to enable school leaders to fulfill the complex responsibilities associated with inclusive school development. Originality/value: Although the Agency is strongly associated with the education of children with special educational needs and disabilities, all member countries have the shared vision to support inclusive education systems so that all learners of any age are provided with meaningful, high-quality educational opportunities in their local community. While its projects are firmly rooted in the 2006 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, its work is also influenced by the concept of inclusion as promoted in the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4) “to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”.","Core Functions Of School Leaders; Distributed Leadership; Inclusive Education; Inclusive School Leadership; Instructional Leadership; Transformational Leadership","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083995309"

In earlier work, we designed and implemented a prototype catalogue for geospatial educational resources, aimed at a target audience in higher education. The success of search and discovery in any catalogue relies heavily on the metadata that describes catalogue entries. Initial feedback showed that users find it difficult to use some of the metadata elements in the prototype to describe their teaching materials. In order to better understand their difficulties and further refine the metadata for describing educational resources that are used for geospatial purposes specifically, we asked a number of participants to describe geospatial educational resources according to four sets of metadata attributes. This paper presents the results of the study and recommends a set of metadata attributes that are specifically useful for geospatial educational resources. Implementation trade-offs are discussed, e.g., deciding between metadata attributes that are very specific or more generic, and catalogue entries that are immediately available to Web search engines without any quality checks vs. catalogue entries that are moderated by a community of educators before publishing them. By providing metadata about geospatial educational resources, the international geospatial community can contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.","Catalogue; Educational Resource; Geospatial; Learning Object Metadata; Metadata; Open Education; Teaching; Commerce; Economic And Social Effects; Search Engines; Educational Resource; Geospatial Community; Higher Education; Initial Feedback; Life Long Learning; Open Educational Resources; Quality Education; Teaching Materials; Metadata","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091985659"

Still, current literature on education for SDGs does not always consider the infrastructural and practical factors affecting the success or the failure of the practices mentioned above. The main purpose of this paper is to organize and describe a set of ongoing education for sustainability strategies that took place from 2016 to 2019 in Italian universities. Eighteen best practices have been collected after a national call by the Italian Network of Sustainable Universities (RUS), that aimed to map the current landscape of SDGs-related actions. Data have been analyzed based on the qualitative description provided by each university, according to four criteria: trigger, course type, approach (top-down/bottom-up) and declared mission. Results are depicted as a map of the current Italian higher education system, where a predominant mission (teaching) and a prevalent driver (top-down) have been found as the frequent features of SDGs educational initiatives. Further developments highlight the value of this first country-wide mapping of the Italian Higher Education Institutions implementing SDGs in their activities, that can avoid the isolation of individual experiences and, most importantly, can suggest some comparability and transferability criteria for similar cases.","Higher Education Institutions; Mission-oriented; Partnership For The Goals; Sdgs Implementation; Transdisciplinarity; Education; Higher Education; Learning; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; University Sector; Italy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088277213"

It is through education that an improved quality of life ensues with people’s acquisition of knowledge and skills beneficial to society, at large. Inclusive education, however, is an issue among countries with marginalized ethnic groups. In Europe, the onslaught of migrants from various parts of the world challenges educational systems to be more attuned to the needs of children of migrant families. In Asia, on the other hand, a gnawing concern is for education to reach indigenous peoples in rural areas. This paper examines how inclusive education is key to accomplishing Sustainable Development Goal 4 which is “to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. It tackles the accessibility of alternative learning systems in the developing world, with the Philippines as a case in point. This paper focuses on the process of interface utilized by the Philippines’ Department of Education and the Ayta, an indigenous group living in the Philippine province of Zambales to address the unique conditions of this marginalized ethnic minority. It also investigates the effects of these indigenization efforts on the Ayta’s cultural rights. This paper uses mixed methods such as key informant interview, focus group discussion, survey questionnaire, secondary research and Filipino psychology research methods. This paper underscores how partnership between government and stakeholders is significant in arriving at the goal of inclusive education. This is reflected in the collaborative relationship fostered between the Philippine government and the Ayta and how the partnership positively affected the Ayta’s cultural rights based on a more culturally-appropriate educational curriculum.","Alternative Learning System; Ethnic Minorities; Inclusive Education; Indigenous People’s Education Framework; Philippines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093114809"

Needless to say, education is a fundamental goal that contributes to fulfillment of several other goals of equal importance. As such, higher education is a major factor in poverty alleviation, SDG1: “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”, through enhancing job opportunities, SDG8: “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that illiteracy and poverty are two major factors that produce poor health and poor social development, SDG3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. It is also known that low literacy impacts on mortality and quality of life. In this chapter, fundamental changes in education and higher education are outlined, particularly in innovation and entrepreneurship that are needed in order to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The study explored the lived experiences of the mothers of children with ASD, including but not limited to the mothers’ stress, behavioral difficulties, coping strategies, religious, and social support related experiences. This study incorporated the factors that played a part in mothers’ experiences about ASD and whether they receive enough social and educational support. Most mothers are part of the middle and upper-middle class as they can afford extensive therapies for their children. An interpretive phenomenological approach was adopted using 15 interviews conducted in the sociocultural context of Karachi. The interviews gave an in-depth analysis, showing the mothers to be loving and caring towards their child from the start of the journey. This article highlights the lack of institutional as well as emotional support for special populations in Pakistan; thus, the findings are crucial for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education that has the potential to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.

Whereas the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focused on primary education, the SDGs, through SDG 4 which is devoted to education, call on Member States to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. The inclusion of lifelong learning has awakened hopes for a stronger role of ALE in global education agendas and policies. In principle, the ten targets of SDG 4 open up clear possibilities for ALE. However, the author cautions that there is cause for scepticism that ALE, in particular human rights-based ALE, will receive more attention under the SDGs than it did under the MDGs. The article is structured into three sections. The first section traces the emergence of a rights-based approach to adult education as an international paradigm, with particular attention given to the role of UNESCO. The second section discusses how the rights-based approach to adult education has been contested by other actors in the field of education for development. In the final section, the author draws on recent empirical data to reflect on the role of ALE in the age of the SDGs.","Adult Learning And Education (ale); Education As A Human Right; Lifelong Learning; Literacy; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Unesco; Adult; Human Rights; Learning; Literacy; Primary Education; Sustainable Development; Unesco","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068240421"

Both are intertwined and cannot be meaningfully discussed in isolation. Nevertheless, it is education that serves the cause towards environmental sustainability. This would suggest that education in itself is incomplete if it fails to firmly integrate environmental sustainability within its agenda. A closer look at the SDGs suggests that the notion of environmental sustainability is not expressly integrated within Goal 4 on education (“Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”). While numerous points elaborate the individual targets, SDG Goal 4 makes no single explicit reference to any concern related to environmental sustainability. This raises a number of important questions. If environmental sustainability is not even embedded within the goal, can education be expected to deliver environmental sustainability outcomes? Do the SDGs, in aiming for “sustainable development”, predominantly refer to economic development, merely sustained over time and space? Are policy makers and development professionals in danger of inadvertently divorcing the inalienable union that education has with environmental sustainability? Is the sustainable development agenda risking diluting the fundamental basis—environmental sustainability—upon which it was originally articulated (Brundtland Report in Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our common future 1987)? These are enquiries the research addresses.

Values related to sustainability promote a certain type of pedagogy in which the child should be allowed to take initiatives, think, and reflect. This requires high-quality early childhood education. How sustainability concepts can be applied to both content and pedagogy are discussed, as well as different preconditions that are necessary so that all children can access education for sustainability. Important preconditions of education for sustainability include a need for awareness that lifelong learning is applicable to early childhood education, as well as educated staff who are aware about what is relevant for young children to learn about sustainability.","Curriculum; Early Childhood Education; Pedagogy; Sustainability; Sustainable Developmental Goals","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034787052"

Embedded in this broad goal, Educate A Child (EAC) is the only global support program that focuses solely on out-of-school children1 (OOSC) across the world, including Southeast Asia. EAC is an initiative of the Education Above All Foundation of Qatar. It works through co-funding interventions of trusted partners to bring OOSC into quality primary education programs. It pairs with organizations to support innovative programs and methods of education for the most vulnerable children, especially those affected by poverty, conflict, natural disaster, and cultural barriers. EAC's partners range from international educational, development, and humanitarian organizations to locally-based groups. It currently has around fifty partners, also in Southeast Asia, among others, Aide et Action and its 25-NGO consortium in Cambodia, the Monastic Education Development Group (MEDG), Save the Children, UNESCO, UNHCR, and United World Schools. Dr. Mary Joy Pigozzi is Executive Director of EAC and member of the WISE Prize Committee.","Out-of-school Children; Primary Education; Qatari Philanthropy; Sdg4; Southeast Asia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039912875"

In the United States, the tensions between higher education and its public demands are evident as institutions struggle to support more participants than ever before in a system with finite resources. Recent assessments of the purposes and outcomes for American higher education show ongoing concerns over achievement gaps that persist across economic, racial, ethnic and gender lines, declining civic engagement among college graduates, and overall outcomes that are primarily ""private and personal rather than public and societal"" (National Center for Postsecondary Improvement, 2002, p. 4). Yet, the overarching analysis of higher education in recent years has focused on its fulfillment of the social contract with constituents (RAND Corporation, 1997). The level of scrutiny faced by ""public elites"" such as the University of California (UC) and other institutions are examples of the responsiveness required to address agendas for broader inclusion and equitable participation for all the members served by given universities. As suggested by President Emeritus Richard Atkinson, ""No U.S. public university can survive over the long term unless its students, faculty, and staff reflect in some approximate but genuine fashion the people who support it"" (Atkinson & Pelfrey, 2004, p. 11). Postsecondary systems across the globe have similar challenges. Newly restructured systems, such as universities in South Africa, are closely tied to the hopes for democratic growth and global competition in the country (Cele, 2004). Even in nations with longer postsecondary histories, higher education must contend with public discourses for change to facilitate lifelong learning, poverty reduction, and social and democratic reforms, among its diverse populace (Morley, 1997). What lies ahead for the University of the new millennium? And in what ways can higher education respond to daunting social agendas while forging its role for human capital development for civic engagement? The chapters in this section examine several major issues facing the University relevant to the ""diversity imperative"" for the new century. The initial topics of student equity and access in higher education (Allen), and assessments of the outcomes associated with higher education for minorities (Phillips, Law and Turney), emphasize important considerations. While quantitative appraisals about the composition of our learning communities require ongoing study, we need to place greater emphasis on the quality of the student experience that will influence short- and long-term learning outcomes. College contexts - the cultures that manifest from the articulated values and perspectives of individuals in higher education environments - play critical roles in fostering the intellectual and social development of students. Identifying the benefits that diverse learning communities have on individual student and societal outcomes (Hurtado) and on career development for undergraduates (Bonous-Hammarth), highlight a dynamic between the University and student. The interplay between student-institutional culture and institutional culture-student shows the fluid and yet malleable nature of our learning communities. While much of the discussion about diversity in higher education focuses on specific institutional contexts and the number of individuals from various backgrounds who participate in these environments, there are opportunities to transform the entire landscape of higher education in discussions of gender. Specifically, gendered realities in higher education intersect with many other identities of the self, and discussions to understand these constructions outside of our current institutional norms may lead to more effective avenues for inclusion in education (Morley). The final chapters of this section continue the important discussions of inclusion with focus on the challenges for the newly reconfigured University in South Africa (Africa) and in India (Wankhede). These national systems of higher education have opportunities to live the lessons learned from imported models while remaining uniquely sensitive to their respective cultural nuances. While it is tempting to examine the multiple templates of higher education for application in new environments, there are still unique circumstances that will and should prevent thorough adoption of any one existing model of higher education. When we ask ourselves about the future of mass higher education, we are questioning the University's potential to maintain a public trust while forging paths of inquiry and knowledge generation to benefit rapidly changing demographic and cultural landscapes. In this respect, change in higher education is always near, but planned change in higher education requires deliberate interventions. Our discussions thus far in this book demonstrate how the mandate for diversity in higher education will undergo continued change - whether focused on affirmative action policies for inclusion of specific underrepresented groups, or verbal rationalizations that provide slight support of inclusive philosophies at the core of our value systems. The best way to ensure that the University of current and future times remains sensitive to the complex and interwoven elements of diversity that must be addressed in our learning communities would be to problematize culturally appropriate strategies for our institutions. As suggested by Kezar and Eckel (2002), cultural approaches to institutional change ensure that change strategies that would be focused on goals such as diversity in higher education would occur with contextual understanding about the institutional culture, agents involved in the change process, and relevant strategies most consistent with the academic milieu to attain outcomes. Institutional cultures provide the lenses to view and assess the best strategies for the University - actually its members - to use in creating more diverse learning communities. In short, members of the University would need to recognize that goals of diversity - to promote learning in-depth - align closely with their goals for scholarship and knowledge generation to ensure that access and equity remain core values in academe. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
