While some transitions may promote positive growth, many transitions can also engender significant stress, which can potentially culminate in mental health difficulties and, in some unfortunate instances, psychopathology, especially when individuals lack adequate support. Traditional healthcare systems, already strained by increasing demands and limited resources, frequently offer inflexible, diagnostic-driven pathways with limited accessibility. Therefore, individuals, especially adolescents and emerging adults, have turned increasingly to non-traditional sources for mental health information and support. The internet, in particular, has become an indispensable resource for individuals seeking support around difficult life transitions, including the transition to adulthood. Multimedia content, especially videos, offers unique advantages: cultural sensitivity, peer-shared experiences, the ability to overcome language and literacy barriers and many more which are tailored to individual needs. Innovative content strategies, such as storytelling or expert interviews, can play a pivotal role in reducing the stigma associated with seeking mental health help during life transitions, which may, in turn, increase the likelihood for at-risk individuals to seek formal support if required, and can supplement traditional care with low-threshold information. However, the digital landscape is not without its inherent challenges, including misinformation. While there are frameworks to evaluate and promote credible, evidence-based health content online, there needs to be greater effort to ensure its frictionless integration into formal clinical pathways, when appropriate. To address the complex challenges and fully realize the benefits of digital media mental health care during life transitions, a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach is essential: this includes collaboration between healthcare providers, policymakers, researchers, technology companies and content creators. We should prioritise developing culturally inclusive, engaging, evidence-based content; promoting digital literacy among users and providers; and expanding access to information, support, and self-management tools specifically designed for individuals navigating life’s transitions. Investment in research and further advocacy for policies is necessary to ensure quality and sustainability of content as well as equitable access for a more resilient and mentally healthy society.","Digital Literacy; Digital Media Mental Health Support; Life Transitions; Mental Health; Mental Health Content; Mental Health Stigma; Mental Wellbeing; Multi-stakeholder Approach; Multimedia Formats; Access To Information; Age; Bereavement; Chronic Disease; Digital Media; Divorce; Education; Human; Internet; Internet Literacy; Life; Life Transition; Marriage; Mental Health Care; Note; Parenthood; Psychological Well-being; Retirement; Unemployment; Workforce","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008291009"

In developing countries, 27% of adolescents are affected by anaemia, compared to a much lower prevalence of 6% in developed countries. This scoping review aims to investigate the intake of junk food and the development of anaemia, providing a foundation for future research in this field. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, EBSCO, CINHAL, WOS and ProQuest using specific keywords. Inclusion criteria comprised all quantitative studies examining the association between nutrition and the development of anaemia. Articles selected for analysis were restricted to those published in English Language between 2014–2024 and available as full-text articles. Results: Among the articles that were screened, 20 articles met the criteria for data extraction. Four studies did not reveal statistically significant correlations between nutrition and the development of anaemia, while two studies provided evidence for significant associations. The findings indicated increased anaemia was associated with (a) fast food intake, western pattern of diet, poor eating habits, omission of breakfast and (b) diminished consumption of fruits and vegetables, iron intake, seafood, nuts, and seeds. Conclusion: The existing evidence suggests a link between the consumption of junk food and the prevalence of anaemia among adolescents. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that thoroughly explore this connection. This gap in research underscores the urgent need for more in-depth studies to understand how modifiable risk factors like junk food consumption contribute to anaemia in adolescents, with the goal of improving prevention and management strategies. Addressing this issue aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, which focuses on ending preventable deaths of children and addressing adolescent health. Additionally, this research also contributes to end hunger, achieve food security, and improve nutrition.","Adolescents; Anaemia; Consumption; Junk Food; Wellbeing; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Adult; Anemia; Data Extraction; Developed Country; Developing Country; Dietary Pattern; Disease Association; Disease Course; Eating Habit; English (language); Fast Food; Food Intake; Frequency; Fruit Consumption; Human; Incidence; Iron Intake; Junk Food; Lifestyle; Medline; Nut; Nutrition; Nutritional Deficiency; Obesity; Physical Activity; Plant Seed; Prevalence; Quantitative Study; Review; Risk Factor; Scoping Review; Scopus; Sea Food; Sociodemographics; Systematic Review; Vegetable Consumption; Vulnerable Population; Wellbeing; Western Diet","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005103944"

Therefore, psychology is one of the key disciplines contributing to the study of Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 to transform our world by addressing global challenges. This study examines the distribution of psychology studies across Sustainable Development Goals, subfields, publication years, document types, countries, languages, researchers, journals, and keywords using bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer mapping. Most of the studies focus on Goal 3 “good health and well-being”, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all individuals at all ages (33.06%), and most studies in psychology have been multidisciplinary (36.90%). Researchers published most of these Sustainable Development Goals studies in 2022 (25.4%), primarily as articles (77.40%). Researchers in the United States conducted 17.02% of these studies, and 97.34% of them were written in English. Di Fabio leads in authorship (1.60%, n = 6) with 6 citations per publication, whereas Frontiers in Psychology ranks first in publications (documents = 90). “Sustainable development goals” is the most frequently used keyword. The results suggest that psychology makes a significant contribution to Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in areas such as health, well-being, and environmental behavior. The results indicate that these psychology studies will likely increase rapidly. Researchers should pursue multidisciplinary, international studies on understudied Sustainable Development Goals, while policymakers should incorporate psychological insights and increase support for sustainability efforts.","Bibliometric Analysis; Bibliometrics; Environmental Psychology; Psychology; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003446092"

Goal Three of the agenda aims to ""Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"" by improving access to health care, reducing disparities, and reducing mortality and morbidity for the world's population. Nowhere is this more critical than surgical care access, where AI can reduce disparities and improve outcomes for underserved populations-rural communities, special populations, and oncology patients-while posing risks if not adequately grounded in ethical and equitable practices. We introduce the three-pronged approach as a metaphorical framework to mitigate the risks and enhance AI's benefits in addressing access to surgical care. By focusing on data quality, continuous system evaluation, and ethical governance, we can ensure AI delivers equitable, effective, and safe health care outcomes for all, especially for the most vulnerable.","Resident Education; Robotic Surgery; Social And Electronic Media; Socioeconomic; Special Topics; Artificial Intelligence; Health Care Access; Health Care Disparity; Health Equity; Human; Surgery; Artificial Intelligence; Health Equity; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Surgical Procedures, Operative","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003685102"

""Comfort Stations"" were establishments where ""Comfort Women"" were compelled to participate in sexual relations with the Imperial Japanese Army men. The term ""comfort women"" is a piece of linguistic propaganda intended to conceal the fact that the Japanese Government not only sanctioned but also facilitated human trafficking and sexual exploitation of women who came from impoverished backgrounds. The extent of their exploitation, as was revealed later over the years, justifies the contention that the Japanese Government all but forced women into ""sex slavery"" for the sole purpose of keeping their army going. The victims of the Japanese Comfort System are still without justice, nearly eight decades after the Second World War. The injustice that the victims of this system face is in apparent contravention with Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 5, which mandate promoting activities to ensure healthy lives, promote well-being for all at all ages and achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, respectively.","Comfort Stations; Imperial Japanese Army; Reparations; Sexual Exploitation; Trafficking","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214486501"

One of the SDG3 targets is to reduce under-five mortality and infant mortality. In rural areas of Indonesia, there is a lack of access to medical facilities (healthcare services, anthropometry tools) and health workers, so low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g) in rural areas remains high. This study aimed to determine the profile of and test the factors that cause LBW in Indonesia. Methods: This study used secondary data from the National Socio-Economic Survey/Suneei Sosial Ekonomi Naslonal (SUSENAS) 2021 with a national sample of 4 711 455 women (weighted), which is analyzed descriptively and inferentially. The analysis was conducted descriptively to determine the profile and distribution of LBW at the national and provincial levels, while inferential analysis was performed using logistic regression to determine the variables that most influence LBW. Results: The prevalence of LBW in Indonesia was found to be 11.7%. North Maluku was the province with the highest LBW rate (20.1%), and West Java had the highest number of LBW infants in Indonesia, with 104 585 infants. This study found that smoking, rural areas, poor nutrition, age of childbirth, age and birth spacinc significantly affected the incidence of LBW in Indonesia. In rural Indonesia, women tend to give birth to LBW babies (adjusted ode ratio: 1.249; 95%CI: 1.241-1.256). The incidence of LBW babies in rural areas was higher than in urban areas (12.9% v 10.8%) in Indonesia. Conclusion: This study concluded that smoking behavior is the main variable that influences the incidence of LBW in Indonesia. Therefore, there should be assistance to families by prioritizing significant factors for LBW (living in a village/rural area, low education, smoking behavior, not or rarely consuming nutritious food, maternal age at first birth <21 years, age at last birth?>35 years and birth spacing <33 months). Especially for rural aree governments need to improve access to healthcare facilities including availability of anthropometry tools, health workers, and healthcare services.","Child Health; Indonesia; Infants; Low Birth Weight; Nutrition; Smoking; Stunting; Adolescent; Adult; Epidemiology; Female; Human; Indonesia; Low Birth Weight; Male; Newborn; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Risk Factor; Rural Population; Socioeconomics; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217878141"

Accordingly, this research summarizes seminal studies and draw on it to identify the waves of challenges affecting this sector. This study aims to contribute to the discourse on sustainability in health-care organizations (HCOs) by exploring the role of performance monitoring systems (PMS), such as the balanced scorecard (BSC). Design/methodology/approach: To explore this issue further, the authors illustrate the transformation model of the HCOs, from inputs to outcomes. The authors rely on the systems and organizational analysis/behavior theories. They use a qualitative case study approach (the American University of Beirut Medical Center in Lebanon – AUBMC) to delve into the intricacies of PMS implementation in an HCO. Findings: The authors’ findings underline the role of PMS in operationalizing sustainability within HCOs. By adopting a PMS, HCOs can facilitate the integration of environmental, social and economic factors into decision-making processes. HCOs can enhance their performance and create long-term value. Research limitations/implications: Despite the important findings, this paper is not enough to “generalize” and “replicate” the results. However, this paper is able to highlight a road map for HCO’s managers. Furthermore, it does not take into account the impact of artificial intelligence on the design, implementation and analysis of the results produced by such a PMS. Practical implications: This paper highlights the importance of strong leadership and a well-defined approach for HCOs to achieve sustainability. It highlights that sustainability is no longer just about reputation; sustainability can enhance organizational performance across various aspects. Leaders need to integrate sustainability into the organization’s mission, vision and values. Thus, implementing a PMS like the BSC is crucial. On the other hand, a focus on sustainability can attract and retain top talent who are increasingly concerned about environmental and social responsibility. Furthermore, sustainability efforts should consider patient needs. And finally, sustainability can drive innovation through developing new services, partnerships and technologies that reduce environmental impact and improve financial performance. Social implications: This study highlights how adopting a sustainable approach in HCOs aligns with and supports achieving the UN-SDGs related to health care (SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages). The findings conclude on the HCO’s sustainability efforts to: improve access to quality care (by providing more efficient operations and resource allocation, potentially allowing HCOs to treat more patients and improve access to quality care − SDG 3.1, 3.8); encourage investments in preventative care programs and public health initiatives (by contributing to a healthier population and reducing treatment burdens − SDG 3.3, 3.4); support environmental responsibility (by reducing energy consumption and waste disposal in HCOs can lessen their environmental footprint and contribute to a healthier planet − SDG 3.9); focus on the employee well-being (by creating a more positive work environment with better air quality and potentially stress-reducing practices, potentially improving employee well-being − SDG 3.9); and innovate for better health care (sustainability can drive innovation in areas such as telemedicine, renewable energy sources for powering HCOs and developing environmentally friendly medical equipment − SDG 3.b). Originality/value: This research contributes to the emerging field of sustainability in health care by providing empirical evidence of the role of PMS in achieving sustainability goals. The case study offers practical insights for HCOs seeking to improve their sustainability performance and highlights the potential of a PMS as a strategic management tool.","Corporate Social Performance; Health-care Organizations; Organizational Behavior; Organizational Theory; Performance Monitoring Systems; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214036504"

Traditional hexapod systems are constrained by the fixed elongation range of their struts, often necessitating multiple replacements throughout the treatment process. These replacements introduce inefficiencies and pose risks to maintaining proper alignment. The innovation proposed in this study is the design and development of an advanced telescopic strut system, referred to as the T-Strut, which significantly extends the available elongation range without requiring replacement. A significant accuracy in elongation adjustment can be achieved thanks to the adopted motion transmission system, which, even with substantial rotations of the wheel, results in very small lengthening or shortening. This paper details the mechanical design of the T-Strut, its integration with a motorized worm gear mechanism, and the incorporation of an optical encoder for precise measurement and feedback. Additionally, the system is supported by custom software that automates the control and adjustment of the struts based on predefined treatment plans, improving both the accuracy and safety of the fixation process. By automating adjustments, reducing manual intervention, and maintaining alignment throughout the treatment, this system offers a promising solution for advancing current orthopedic fixation methods.","Orthopedic Treatments; Robotic Hexapod Device; Sdg3 - Ensure Healthy Lives And Promote Well-being For All At All Ages; Electric Power Transmission; Elongation; Fracture Fixation; Orthopedics; Struts; Bone Fracture; Design And Development; Fracture Treatment; Motion Transmission; Orthopaedic Applications; Orthopedic Treatment; Robotic Hexapod Device; Sdg3 - Ensure Healthy Life And Promote Well-being For All At All Age; Treatment Process; Well Being; Robotics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008368418"

Intervention strategies such as provision of good quality services and timely as well as balanced information regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights have met a myriad of challenges. This is because such interventions come in the backdrop of religious and cultural rhetoric of taboo and stigma that masquerade as morality imperatives. While the opposition against Adolescents’ and young people’s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (referred to henceforth as AYSRHR) issues is very diverse, in many societies, religious rhetoric and beliefs are a frequently recurring barrier to acceptability and accessibility of essential AYSRH information and services. In Kenya, recent studies have suggested intentional involvement of religious leaders in discourses around AYSRHR in general as an intervention strategy. However, the role of religion in destigmatization and demythologization of anti-SRHR discourses have remained undertheorized. By utilizing Talitha cum hermeneutics of the Circle as a rhetorical criticism framework, this paper shall explore how Circle- Kenya is framing, producing, and disseminating religious public discourses and pedagogies that support the provision of AYSRHR essential services and information. It is hoped that this kind of study will contribute significantly to the body of knowledge on the role of religion in addressing the triple threat challenge of teenage pregnancy, new HIV infection, and gender and sexual-based violence among adolescents, as well as suggesting valuable localized pathways in attainment of Kenya’s Vision 2030 and the global Sustainable Development Goals 3- Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.","Anti-srhr Discourses; Demythologization; Destigmatization; Talitha Cum Hermeneutic; Triple Threat Challenge","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002053753"

MTC differs from other differentiated thyroid malignancies due to its heterogeneous nature, presenting complexities in both hereditary and sporadic cases. Traditional management guidelines, which are designed primarily for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), fall short in providing the individualized care required for patients with MTC. In recent years, the sheer volume of data generated from clinical evaluations, radiological imaging, pathological assessments, genetic mutations, and immunological profiles has made it humanly impossible for clinicians to simultaneously analyze and integrate these diverse data streams effectively. This data deluge necessitates the adoption of advanced technologies to assist in decision-making processes. Holomics, which is an integrated approach that combines various omics technologies, along with artificial intelligence (AI), emerges as a powerful solution to address these challenges. Methods: This article reviews how AI-driven precision oncology can enhance the diagnostic workup, staging, risk stratification, management, and follow-up care of patients with MTC by processing vast amounts of complex data quickly and accurately. Articles published in English language and indexed in Pubmed were searched. Results: AI algorithms can identify patterns and correlations that may not be apparent to human clinicians, thereby improving the precision of personalized treatment plans. Moreover, the implementation of AI in the management of MTC enables the collation and synthesis of clinical experiences from across the globe, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the disease and its treatment outcomes. Conclusions: The integration of holomics and AI in the management of patients with MTC represents a significant advancement in precision oncology. This innovative approach not only addresses the complexities of a rare and aggressive disease but also paves the way for global collaboration and equitable healthcare solutions, ultimately transforming the landscape of treatment and care of patients with MTC. By leveraging AI and holomics, we can strive toward making personalized healthcare accessible to every individual, regardless of their economic status, thereby improving overall survival rates and quality of life for MTC patients worldwide. This global approach aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages.","Artificial Intelligence; Holomics; Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma; Precision Oncology; Algorithm; Artificial Intelligence; Cancer Mortality; Cell Differentiation; Clinical Evaluation; Clinical Practice Guideline; Economic Status; Follow Up; Human; Overall Survival; Personalized Cancer Therapy; Personalized Medicine; Practice Guideline; Prevalence; Quality Of Life; Review; Survival Rate; Thyroid Cancer; Thyroid Medullary Carcinoma; Thyroid Papillary Carcinoma; Treatment Outcome","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207645611"

Specifically, we test the indirect effect of servant leadership on in-role performance via a sequential mediating mechanism of job autonomy and emotional exhaustion. Design: A time-lagged design was implemented using data gathered from two-wave online surveys (1 week apart) of registered nurses from Jiangsu Province, China. Methods: Between September 2022 and February 2023, we used Wenjuanxing and Credma, which are two powerful and user-friendly data collection platforms, to distribute online surveys to potential participants. We received a total of 220 usable responses and employed the PROCESS Model 4 and Model 6 to assess our proposed hypotheses. Results: Our proposed model was supported. Servant leadership has a positive indirect effect on nurses' in-role performance through job autonomy and emotional exhaustion. Job autonomy has a negative effect on emotional exhaustion. Additionally, job autonomy mediates the negative relationship between servant leadership and emotional exhaustion. Conclusion: The present research extends existing nursing studies by unravelling the complex mechanisms underlying the relationship between servant leadership and nurses' in-role performance. Our study also identifies the underlying mechanism of how servant leadership mitigates emotional exhaustion by supporting nurses' job autonomy. Impact: The sequential mediation results provide us with a more fine-grained understanding of the relationship between servant leadership and nurses' in-role performance.

It contributes to the health-environment literature but differs from two standpoints. First, it uses two essential sources of carbon emissions: liquid and solid fuels. Second, it engages robust analyses comprising the full sample and sub-samples of income groups to further interrogate this intrinsic relationship. For this purpose, an unbalanced sample of 36 countries from Asia and the Pacific region (2005–2010) is used, and for robust analyses, three econometric methods: bootstrap ordinary least squares (BOLS), instrumental variables (IV), and system generalized method of moments (GMM) are implemented. Empirical results reveal that: (1) liquid and solid fuel emissions exert significant negative outcomes, (2) liquid fuel emissions exhibit the most adverse effect, (3) life expectancy is persistent, and (4) impact of liquid and solid fuel emissions on life expectancy across the income groups is diverse. These findings suggest that the management authorities of Asia and the Pacific region need to devise prudent and effective policies concerning human health and carbon emissions while allocating sufficient budget to the health sector to rescue more lives and, thereby, lengthen the life expectancy in the region.","Asia And The Pacific Region; Carbon Emissions (environmental Degradation); Life Expectancy; Liquid Fuel Emissions; Solid Fuel Emissions; Carbon Emission; Econometrics; Empirical Analysis; Environmental Degradation; Fuel; Health Services; Life Expectancy; Source Identification; Asia; Pacific Islands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161162030"

In the context of Bangladesh, achieving the targets of SDG-3 is a critical priority for public health and development. This study presents a data-driven exploration of SDG-3 in Bangladesh, focusing on maternal and child health indicators. We utilized data from multiple Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2011, 2014, and 2018 to provide a comprehensive analysis of health-related trends and determinants. We employed rigorous statistical techniques, including backward stepwise logistic regression and Pearson correlation coefficients, to uncover insights into the status of maternal and child health in Bangladesh. The prevalence of safe childbirth practices exhibited a gradual improvement from 2011 (32.5%) to 2018 (50.2%). Notably, women with higher levels of education demonstrated a significantly higher likelihood of safe childbirth practices (odd ratio = 1.73, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.19 - 1.97). Additionally, residing in urban regions (odd ratio = 1.07, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.96 - 1.39), having access to mass media (odd ratio = 1.34, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.98 - 1.41), receiving antenatal care (odd ratio = 1.62, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.16 - 1.92), being in the rich wealth index category (odd ratio = 1.13, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.92 - 1.39), and choosing to deliver outside the home (odd ratio = 1.48, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.11 - 1.86) were all associated with a higher likelihood of safe childbirth practices. The findings from this study show the power of data-driven decision-making in shaping health policies and interventions. They reveal critical factors affecting health outcomes, offering a roadmap for policymakers and stakeholders to design evidence-based strategies for improving maternal and child health in Bangladesh. This proposed work not only contributes to the academic understanding of public health in Bangladesh but also serves as a practical guide for those working to achieve SDG-3. As Bangladesh continues its journey toward health and well-being for all, this study sets a benchmark for evidence-based policymaking, emphasizing the importance of data-driven perspectives in the pursuit of SDG.","Bdhs; Logistic Regression; Maternal Health; Mtp; Sdg-3; Correlation Methods; Logistic Regression; Obstetrics; Public Health; Bangladesh; Bdhs; Children Healths; Confidence Interval; Data Driven; Logistics Regressions; Maternal Healths; Mtp; Odd Ratios; Sdg-3; Decision Making","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196358147"

The findings revealed that the ion dissolution rate was higher for greater water temperatures. Methods: Extended sintering of the zinc-modified natural serpentinite powder at 400°C reduced the number of dissolved magnesium ions and increased the number of dissolved zinc ions. The Chili planting experiment was performed with two groups: 1) Chili irrigated with natural magnesium-zinc ionised water (natural magnesium-zinc Chili) and 2) Chili irrigated with distilled water (distilled-water Chili). Results: The natural magnesium-zinc Chilis were discovered to have higher concentrations of magnesium and zinc ions in various parts. Furthermore, during the later stages of growth, the natural magnesium-zinc Chili had a larger body and did not easily turn yellow, resulting in better freshness. This study used modified serpentine powder to cultivate natural magnesium-zinc Chili. Appropriate powder roasting conditions and the rates of magnesium and zinc dissolution were established, and the growth characteristics of natural magnesium-zinc Chili were determined. Conclusion: The Chilis can help humans ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages by sufficient zinc and magnesium intake.","Chili; Immune System; Magnesium Ion; Metabolism; Pepper; Serpentine; Zinc Ion; Calcination; Magnesite; Magnesium; Magnesium Powder; Metal Ions; Sintering; Biological Applications; Chili; Dissolution Rates; Distilled Water; Growth Characteristic; Magnesium Ions; Ore Material; Serpentinite; Water Temperatures; Zinc Ions; Dissolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187215889"

Informal settlements are an integral part of the urban community and its dwellers constitute a significant portion of urban population. Ill health, urban poverty, and living in slums are interconnected. Health and improving the lives of people living in slums are priority goals for international development. Since improved health and better quality of life are results of the efficient performance of several components; so, in context to the SDGs 1, 3, and 6, this research proposes a literature review for a methodology to assess the health vulnerability in the informal settlements due to inadequacies in housing and infrastructure provisions. Water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor families in the slums, increasing the risks and vulnerability to health. The study is purely qualitative, based on all-inclusive literature research from varied sources - UN and WHO reports, research papers, and books. The various literatures examined have led to identify the parameters and sub-parameters to assess health vulnerability in slums. The final parameters identified are - demographic dynamics, socio-economic characteristics, location, housing, land ownership, and physical infrastructure affect the health of the people in the slums and all work together to make a place more or less vulnerable. This review paper can assist the planners to suggest recommendations and models for predicting health risk/vulnerable zones of the informal settlements which could propose site specific interventions, considering health for further development and well-being of the deprived community.","Health; Informal Settlements; Literature Review; Vulnerability; Economics; Housing; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Reviews; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Informal Settlements; Integral Part; International Development; Literature Reviews; Quality Of Life; Urban Community; Urban Population; Urban Poverty; Vulnerability; Well Being; Health Risks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009459681"

SDG 3 in particular aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages and includes several targets to enhance health. This review presents a “headache-tailored” perspective on how to achieve SDG 3 by focusing on six specific actions: targeting chronic headaches; reducing the overuse of acute pain-relieving medications; promoting the education of healthcare professionals; granting access to medication in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC); implementing training and educational opportunities for healthcare professionals in low and middle income countries; building a global alliance against headache disorders. Addressing the burden of headache disorders directly impacts on populations’ health, as well as on the possibility to improve the productivity of people aged below 50, women in particular. Our analysis pointed out several elements, and included: moving forward from frequency-based parameters to define headache severity; recognizing and managing comorbid diseases and risk factors; implementing a disease management multi-modal management model that incorporates pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments; early recognizing and managing the overuse of acute pain-relieving medications; promoting undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing medical education of healthcare professionals with specific training on headache; and promoting a culture that favors the recognition of headaches as diseases with a neurobiological basis, where this is not yet recognized. Making headache care more sustainable is an achievable objective, which will require multi-stakeholder collaborations across all sectors of society, both health-related and not health-related. Robust investments will be needed; however, considering the high prevalence of headache disorders and the associated disability, these investments will surely improve multiple health outcomes and lift development and well-being globally.","Global Burden Of Disease Study; Low- And Middle-income Countries; Medication Overuse Headache; Migraine; Sustainable Development Goals; Tension-type Headache; Analgesic Agent; Biopsychosocial Model; Global Disease Burden; Headache; Health Care Access; Health Care Personnel; Human; Low Income Country; Medical Education; Medication Overuse; Middle Income Country; Primary Headache; Program Feasibility; Review; Aged; Female; Global Health; Headache And Facial Pain; Pain; Public Health; Sustainable Development; Acute Pain; Aged; Female; Global Health; Headache; Headache Disorders; Humans; Public Health; Sustainable Development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175021491"

In view of this goal, sustainable community healthcare services in Norway need to be urgently restructured in light of demographic changes, including an increase in the percentage of older adults in the country. National healthcare policies recommend finding new ways to organise and perform services using new technology, new methods and new solutions. The goal is to ensure greater continuity in the provision of services and softer transitions that enable service users to deal with a smaller number of people. The trust model is one such suggested organisational approach. The goal of the trust model is to involve service users and their next of kin in decisions that concern them while also trusting frontline workers’ professional judgement in assessing the need for services and adjusting them to address changes in the health of the users, thus making the services individually tailored and more flexible. This study aims to explore how organisational work structures influence the delivery of interdisciplinary home-based healthcare services. Methods: Observations, individual-, and focus groups interviews were conducted within community home-based healthcare services in a large Norwegian city with managers at different levels, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, purchaser-unit employees and other healthcare workers. Data was analysed thematically. Results: The results are presented in terms of themes— “Balancing on the margins: Negotiations between the time available, users’ needs, unforeseen events and administrative tasks” and “One gathered unit, but with different work structures”. The results identify organisational work structures that influence the performance of the trust model with regard to its intention of making flexible and individually tailored services available. However, these structures are different for the members of the interdisciplinary team, thus creating several paradoxes that need to be negotiated while fulfilling their daily responsibilities. Conclusion: This study suggests that it is crucial to pay attention to paradoxes and structures experienced by interdisciplinary frontline workers in home-based healthcare services, since they are unavoidable factors that need to be acknowledged when designing approaches for addressing the changes expected in community healthcare services.","Frontline Workers; Health Policies; Interdisciplinary Team; Primary Health Care; Trust Model; Aged; Article; Attention; Employee; Frontline Staff; Health Care Personnel; Health Care Policy; Human; Interview; Manager; Multidisciplinary Team; Negotiation; Nurse; Occupational Therapist; Physiotherapist; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Responsibility; Trust; Community Care; Health Care Delivery; Health Service; Aged; Community Health Services; Delivery Of Health Care; Health Services; Humans; Qualitative Research; Trust","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163705413"

Universal health insurance is broadly seen as a solution to fulfil these targets. West Africa is known to have the most severe maternal mortality and under-five mortality rates in the world. This review seeks to understand whether health insurance provides increased access to services for mothers and children in this region. Methods: The protocol for this review is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (CRD42020203859). A search was conducted in the MEDLINE Complete, Embase, CINAHL Complete and Global Health databases. Eligible studies were from West African countries. The population of interest was mothers and children and the outcome of interest was the impact of health insurance on access to services. Data were extracted using a standardized form. The primary outcome was the impact of health insurance on the rate of utilization and access to services. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool was used for methodological assessment. Results: Following screening, we retained 49 studies representing 51 study settings. In most study settings, health insurance increased access to child and maternal health services. Other determinants of access were socio-economic factors such as wealth and education. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that health insurance may be a viable long-term strategy to alleviate West Africa’s burden of high maternal and child mortality rates. An equity lens must guide future policy developments and significant research is needed to determine how to provide access reliably and sustainably to services for mothers and children in the near and long term.","Health Coverage; Insurance; Maternal And Child; Services; West Africa; Child Health; Health Care Quality; Health Insurance; Health Service; Human; Insurance; Maternal Health Service; Mortality Rate; Outcome Assessment; Physical Activity; Pregnancy; Public Health; Qualitative Research; Quasi Experimental Study; Review; Socioeconomics; Systematic Review; Universal Health Insurance; Africa; Child; Female; Systematic Review (topic); Africa, Western; Child; Female; Humans; Insurance, Health; Maternal Health Services; Pregnancy; Systematic Reviews As Topic; Universal Health Insurance","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176495660"

While extensive literature documents the link between physical frailty and low life satisfaction (LLS) among older adults, research of this nature is limited within low and middle-income countries including India. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between physical frailty and life satisfaction among community-dwelling older men and women in India. Methods: Data come from the 2017–18 wave 1 of the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI), with a sample of 30 390 individuals aged 60 and above (14 559 men and 15 831 women). Physical frailty was assessed using an adapted version of the frailty phenotype developed by Fried and colleagues. Ordered logistic regression models are employed to examine the association between physical frailty and life satisfaction. Results: The prevalence of frailty was higher in older women than men (32.2% vs. 27.5%). Nearly 30.4% of men and 33.8% of women reported having LLS. However, after adjusting for the selected confounders, women were less likely (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.92; CI: 0.87–0.97) to report LLS compared to men. The physically frail older adults were more likely (aOR: 1.40; CI: 1.27–1.55) to report LLS relative to their physically stronger counterparts. Moreover, we found that frail older men had higher odds of reporting LLS than non-frail older men (aOR: 1.25; CI: 1.09–1.43). Also, non-frail older women had lower odds of reporting LLS than non-frail older men (aOR: 0.80; CI: 0.67–0.95). Conclusions: Findings of our study suggest that policies and programs to address later life well-being need to consider gender differences. Doing so would not only help identify older adults most at risk of LLS, but gender differentiated policies would help streamline health expenditures and costs typically relegated to assist all older adults without proper focus on the uniqueness of their social location.","Gender; Life Satisfaction; Older Adults; Physical Frailty; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Article; Community Dwelling Person; Daily Life Activity; Depression; Disease Association; Female; Frailty; Functional Assessment; Functional Status; Geriatric Patient; Health Care Cost; Health Care Policy; Health Care Survey; Health Program; Human; India; Life Satisfaction; Major Clinical Study; Male; Marriage; Occupation; Physical Capacity; Religion; Sex Difference; Social Status; Very Elderly; Frail Elderly; Independent Living; Satisfaction; Sex Factor; Aged; Female; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Humans; Independent Living; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Sex Factors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167570043"

It contributes to the nascent literature stream on energy-health dynamics by introducing a holistic theoretical model to empirically examine the mediation effect of carbon emissions on the relationship between nonrenewable energy and infant mortality rate. Using an unbalanced panel data on 42 Asia and the Pacific countries from 2005 to 2015 and deploying the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, the empirical results are surmised as follows: (i) for the full sample, nonrenewable energy indirectly increases infant mortality rate through increasing carbon emissions. In other words, carbon emissions play a partial mediation role between nonrenewable energy and infant mortality rate; and (ii) for the different income groups, carbon emissions show varying mediation effects. For example, the mediation effect of carbon emissions in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries are found to be similar to those of the full sample of countries. Therefore, based on these findings, we conclude that nonrenewable energy is an essential determinant of infant mortality rate.

This is related to the 2030 agenda sustainable development goal (SDG) 3 to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is presented as a conceptual review that will bridge the research gap between tourism and demography and will focus on travel for older tourists that supports a healthy lifestyle and helps to develop positive feelings of well-being. Findings: The aging population and changing demographic structure will present both possibilities and difficulties for the economy, services and society. Developing innovative ways to assist people to remain active as they age is important, as well as providing measures to combat loneliness is paramount. Tourism and travel can play a significant role to achieve this SDG. Research limitations/implications: A theoretical framework was developed to acknowledge the four contributions (from a physical, psychological [or intellectual], social and spiritual perspective), organizing the findings into a holistic model of health and wellness, which helped to delineate the research. There is a need for a deeper comprehension of a strategy to promote the benefits of leisure travelling that are linked to active ageing and well-being. Practical implications: Destination Marketing Organizations and Tourism marketers need to carefully consider the challenges and implications and identify the key drivers that will be vital to propose strategic solutions and innovations to meet the future demands and expectations of older people in an ageing society. Destination management organizations need to promote and plan “memorable experiences” for older tourists that emphasize the physical health benefits, especially if it is feasible in a natural setting. Social implications: Social experiences are essential in older people’s lives that can help them avoid feelings of depression and isolation. The transformative promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs identify key drivers to propose strategic solutions and innovations to meet the future demands and expectations of older people in an ageing society. Originality/value: This study provides a qualitative overview of extant literature, examining the role of tourism from a physical, psychological (or intellectual), social and spiritual perspective that has proved important in promoting a healthy lifestyle as well as creating positive feelings of well-being for older travellers. It also offers future directions and builds theory through a holistic model of the dimensions of wellness. Further, it proposes future research priorities related to older individuals that are linked to healthy lifestyles, which include tourism experiences.","Agenda 2030; Health; Holistic Model; Older Travellers; Population Ageing; Well-being","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143982415"

Adolescent repeat childbearing (ARC) is associated with poor health outcomes, increased risk of stillbirth, maternal and child mortality, thus a public health concern. The explanations to the high prevalence of repeat childbirth in Soroti district remain unknown. We conducted a phenomenological study where theoretical saturation was achieved with 3 focus group discussions; each comprised of 8 respondents. The questions posed focused on modified socio-ecological model regarding the factors associated with repeat childbirth. These included; perceived individual factors of repeat childbirth, factors related to the sexual partner of the adolescent mother, adolescent mother’s family related factors and factors related to the peers and community of the adolescent mothers. Transcripts were organized and analyzed by QSR Nvivo following deductive approach. Results: Adolescent marriage was viewed as a privilege, family planning methods were viewed as non-functional, man’s demand for sex was unchallengeable and non-supportive families including mistreatment of the participants by their families were perceived as risk factors for ARC. This therefore suggests that in order to prevent repeat adolescent childbearing in Soroti district, and contribute towards the achievement of the SDG numbered three (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) there is need to awaken and strengthen the implementation of the anti-teen marriage programs and policies; strengthen sexual/reproductive education including family planning programs, and addressing identified myths regarding ARC.","Achievement; Adolescent; Adolescent Mother; Article; Childbirth; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Education; Family Planning; Female; Genetic Transcription; Human; Human Experiment; Male; Marriage; Perception; Phenomenology; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Risk Factor; Theoretical Study; Uganda; Wellbeing; Birth; Child; Mother; Sexual Education; Adolescent; Adolescent Mothers; Child; Family Planning Services; Female; Humans; Male; Mothers; Parturition; Pregnancy; Sex Education","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154589921"

This new improved smart society will rely on the use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to gather and analyze large amounts of data. This is then used to improve many aspects of society leading to sustainable development and the achievement of the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). SDG-3 is to “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” This can be achieved in healthcare in society 5.0 through the use and integration of these new technologies. AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) allow the creation of automated systems capable of learning, identifying features in patient data, and making a decision regarding diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment choices. AI can also be used to integrate large amounts of data to create digital twins of patients or populations to allow for more accurate modeling in many healthcare-related scenarios and implement precision medicine. Much of the data required to imple-ment these technologies can be gathered through the IoT which allows personalized data regarding an individual’s health, environment, and activity to be gathered by smart connected devices through the Internet. To be successful, this digital infor-mation must be used in such a way as to result in the merging of cyberspace and physical space through the integration of cyber-physical systems. All these new developments will require and drive a revolutionary change in the healthcare ecosystem. The use of these new healthcare technologies also presents governments and healthcare systems with new legal issues, ethical questions, and fears surround-ing the restructuring of the healthcare ecosystem. Additionally, the implementation of these new technologies is complicated by the current worldwide energy crisis. The solutions to these problems are already being sought. Technologies such as AI, IoT, and digital twins are being used to design and manage newer smarter electricity grids and assist in the introduction of new energy sources, while Blockchain technology can possibly provide a solution to issues surrounding the responsible storage and management of data. The use of these technologies to implement healthcare based on the concept of Society 5.0 promises to give individuals a healthier, longer, and more productive life.","Ai; Blockchain Technology; Cloud Computing; Digital Twins; Energy Crisis; Ethics; Healthcare; Iot; Privacy; Rights; Safety; Security; Society 5.0; Un Sdg3","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205655873"

Targets 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.A relate to non-communicable diseases, mental well-being and behavioural risks, including injuries. Target 3.7 is about reproductive health while Target 3.8 advocates universal health coverage, which is the core value and principle in the primary health movement of the World Health Organization since the historical 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration of ‘Health for All by the Year 2000’. Target 3.9 describes the impacts of environment on morbidity and mortality. Target 3.B suggests access to essential medicine and vaccines. The remaining two targets, 3.C and 3.D, draw the attention to financing health and capacity building in all countries. SDG 3 addresses all major health priorities for all people in the community during their life course. This chapter will illustrate the impacts of SDG 3 and its targets in healthcare, in both the public and private sectors, with particular focus on the business side of the health, which is blooming in developed societies with the establishment of multinational medical enterprise and health insurance organisations. Issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic will be addressed with respect to SDG 3, including strengthening capacity in public health practices in outbreaks management, training and competency of professionals, and technology adoption in the community.","Covid-19; Digital Health; Health Insurance; Sustainable Development Goal 3; Sustainable Environment; Universal Health Coverage","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194589488"

This will be measured in terms of 13 targets, many of which are direct life and death issues. For example, specific targets relate to reduction of maternal, neonatal and under-5 mortality, addressing communicable and non-communicable diseases, and reducing other causes of death including substance abuse (drugs, alcohol, tobacco) and road traffic accidents. A focus on improved quality of life is also seen in the target of ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, and providing access to quality essential healthcare and safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. This chapter will begin with an overview of SDG3, outlining the 13 targets and associated indicators. It will then turn to an evaluation of how well we are doing in relation to this goal, drawing on data from 2015, when the SDGs were instigated, the current status of the indicators, and the latest predictions for the 2030 end date of the SDGs. An international and regional comparative perspective will be used in order to set the context. While the perception may be that Europe is ahead of other regions in achieving targets related to SDG3, there are also areas where the region is lagging behind. As we look within Europe, it will also become clear that there are distinct variations at a national level, and that specific challenges remain. Some consideration will be given to the fact that some of the progress made in many health areas before the COVID-19 pandemic, including improving maternal and children health, increasing immunisation coverage, and reducing communicable diseases, has now halted or even been reversed. Disruptions to essential health services, even within relatively wealthy regions such as Europe, have affected services mental, neurological and substance use disorders; HIV and hepatitis B and C; cancer screening and services for other non-communicable diseases. Moving beyond the statistical data, the chapter then turns to consider some of the questions arising out of SDG3 within the European context. Across the continent, the population structure is changing. Two forms of demographic ageing are being experienced. On the one hand, ‘bottom up’ ageing is being seen as birth rates decline and the younger age cohorts of the population pyramid become smaller than the older generations. On the other hand, ‘top down’ ageing is also evident as life expectancy increases. While European governments are attempting to address this issue, one of the consequences of more people living longer is that there is an increase in a range of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, as we appear to have entered the late stages of epidemiological transition, health issues associated with degenerative diseases, lifestyle and emerging diseases are on the rise. In its final section, the chapter will look outward from the European perspective, considering responsibilities and ethical issues relating to overseas aid, globalisation and policies which impact on the capacity of other regions and nations to achieve the targets set out by SDG3.","Demographic Change; Europe; Health; Population; Sdg3; Well-being","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184735442"

This includes factors such as the index and progress in sustainable development, sources of investment resources, and healthcare costs for 2020. Logit and probit regression models are employed for the analysis. The results indicate the absence of a statistically significant relationship between the volume of investments from the state, businesses, and households of countries and their level of SDG 3 achievement. However, an interesting finding emerges regarding healthcare expenditures under state insurance programs among European countries, which show a greater extent of progress in achieving SDGs compared to voluntary insurance programs.

Furthermore, many Africans and foreign visitors who want to track their diet to lose weight and stay healthy by continuing to eat local dishes struggle to find an application or good dataset with information on the daily dishes and calories that are specific to their cuisine. This paper proposes a new system for direct, real-time calorie rating and West African daily dishes recognition. Our first study was conducted on 11 types of Ivorian daily dishes using a dataset of 718 images. Our system combines two classifiers: one for dish recognition and another for calorie estimation. The calorie classifier groups dishes into calorie classes (high, middle, low), and both dish detection and calorie classification use YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) on small dataset. After training, our different models dish recognition and calorie classification achieved accuracies of 94.8% and 90.0%, respectively.","Calorie Classification; Calorie Estimation; Food Recognition; West African Dishes; Blood Pressure; Calorie Classification; Calorie Estimations; Common Disease; Food Recognition; Healthcare Systems; High Blood Pressures; Real- Time; Small Data Set; Well Being; West African Dish; Classification (of Information)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172001023"

Identifying the parallel crises as such is a positive step that can enable governance and science to catch up to one another and realign. As it is now, the opioid crises are acting as brakes on development as defined by the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs). Both crises affect UN member states’ ability to reach the Goal 3 ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’ of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among the nine targets for Goal 3, the two opioid crises affect progress toward Target 3.5, on strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse, and Target 3.8, providing Universal Health Coverage (UHC), and adequate access to essential medicines. The parallel opioid crises, which both represent misalignment between anachronistic governance structures and epistemic developments, have several things in common beyond the opioid molecules themselves: regulatory and health system deficits that interact pathologically with baked in cultural stigma around psychoactive substances, stigma evident in the designation of these substances in international law as ‘narcotic drugs’. Community regeneration, educational development, and governance reforms can now replace politicized rather than evidence-based and public health–promoting drug policies that block progress toward both SDG 3 targets in different countries for different reasons. Quantification of serious health-related suffering (SHS) pertaining to a range of health conditions and demographic groups now provides the epidemiological evidence to legitimate such a timely paradigm shift.","Harm Reduction; Opioid Crises; Palliative Care; Sustainable Development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160424607"

Although the treatment and projected outcome of CF has significantly improved with the advent of CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein modulator (CFTRm) therapy, there remains significant global inequality with regards to access to these life-saving and life-altering drugs. Elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) triple combination therapy, first licensed in the United States in 2019, has rapidly become the standard of care for children aged 6 years and older in most high-income countries for individuals with CFTR variants responsive to ETI. Negotiated agreements for access to ETI are currently in place in North America,Europe, Israel,Australia and New Zealand. However, less priority has been given to negotiate agreements for access to CFTRm in low-middle income countries(LMIC) with significant CF populations such as Central and South America, India, the Middle East, and Southern Africa. These countries and individuals living with CF are therefore effectively being left behind, in direct conflict with the stated principle of the 2030 SDGs. In this review, we highlight the current global inequity in access to CFTRm drugs and its impact on widening disparities between high-income countries and LMIC in CF outcomes and survival. We further discuss the reasons for this inequity and explore the ethical- and human rights-based principles and dilemmas that clinicians, families, governments, and healthcare funders must consider when prioritizing fair and affordable access to expensive CFTRm drugs. Lastly, we propose possible solutions to overcoming the barriers to accessing affordable CFTRm drugs in LMIC and illustrate with examples how access to drug therapies for other conditions have been successfully negotiated in LMIC through innovative partnerships between governments and pharmaceutical industries.","Cftr Modulator Drugs; Cystic Fibrosis; Disparity; Ethics; Low-middle Income Countries; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Elexacaftor; Ivacaftor; Tezacaftor; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Elexacaftor; Ivacaftor; Tezacaftor; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Cystic Fibrosis; Health Care Cost; Health Disparity; Health Literacy; Hepatitis C; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Low Income Country; Lung Function; Middle Income Country; Mortality; Newborn Screening; Short Survey; Social Determinants Of Health; Sustainable Development Goal; Tuberculosis","Short survey","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152537300"

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy on Oral Health calls for prioritizing environmentally sustainable and less invasive oral health care, and planetary health. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to power the next generation of oral health services and care, however its relationship with the broader UN and WHO concepts of sustainability remains poorly defined and articulated. We review the double-edged relationships between AI and oral health, to suggest actions that promote a sustainable deployment of AI for oral health. Data: Concepts regarding AI, sustainability and sustainable development were identified and defined. A review of several double-edged relationship between AI and SDGs were exposed for the field of Oral Health. Sources: Medline and international declarations of the WHO, the UN and the World Dental Federation (FDI) were screened. Study selection: One the one hand, AI may reduce transportation, optimize care delivery (SDG 3 “Good Health and Well-Being”, SDG 13 “Climate Action”), and increase accessibility of services and reduce inequality (SDG 10 “Reduced Inequalities”, SDG 4 “Quality Education”). On the other hand, the deployment, implementation and maintenance of AI require significant resources (SDG 12 “Responsible Consumption and Production”), and costs for AI may aggravate inequalities. Also, AI may be biased, reinforcing inequalities (SDG 10) and discrimination (SDG 5), and may violate principles of security, privacy and confidentiality of personal information (SDG 16). Conclusions: Systematic assessment of the positive impact and adverse effects of AI on sustainable oral health may help to foster the former and curb the latter based on evidence. Clinical significance: If sustainability imperatives are actively taken into consideration, the community of oral health professionals should then employ AI for improving effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of oral healthcare; strengthen oral health surveillance; foster education and accessibility of care; ensure fairness, transparency and governance of AI for oral health; develop legislation and infrastructure to expand the use of digital health technologies including AI.","Artificial Intelligence; Ethics; Oral Healthcare; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals; Artificial Intelligence; Climate; Confidentiality; Drug Safety; Education; Ethics; Health; Human; Human Experiment; Identifiable Information; Law; Medline; Planetary Health; Privacy; Review; Security; Sustainable Development Goal; Wellbeing; World Health Organization; Global Health; Health Care Delivery; Sustainable Development; Artificial Intelligence; Delivery Of Health Care; Global Health; Sustainable Development","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141302684"

Evidence suggests that reproductive health rights influence contraception use. Women of Mali are noted to have limited control over their healthcare decisions. As a result, this study aimed at investigating the association between women’s healthcare decision-making capacity and unmet need for contraception in Mali. Methods: This study comprised 6593 women who participated in the 2018 Mali Demographic and Health Survey. Two binary logistic regression models were built. Whilst the first model (crude) involved healthcare decision-making capacity and unmet need for contraception, the second one was a complete model which controlled for all the socio-demographic characteristics. Sample weight was applied and Stata version 13.0 was used for all analyses. Results: Most of the women were not taking their healthcare decisions alone (92.8%). Nearly four out of ten of them indicated that they had unmet need for contraception (35.7%). Unmet need for contraception was high among women aged 45–49 (50.9%) and low among those aged 15–19 (19.2%). Unmet need for contraception was more probable among women who took their healthcare decisions alone compared to those who did not take their healthcare decisions alone [AOR = 1.35; CI = 1.08–1.70]. Compared with women aged 15–19, unmet need was higher among women aged 45–49 [AOR = 4.58, CI = 3.05–6.86]. Richer women had lower odds of unmet need for contraception compared with poorest women [AOR = 0.77, CI = 0.61–0.97]. Conclusion: Women who took their healthcare decisions alone had higher odds of unmet need for contraception. To increase contraceptive use in Mali, it is imperative to take women’s healthcare decisions into consideration to strengthen existing policies geared towards fertility control and improvement in maternal health to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 5. Sustainable Development Goal 3 seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages whilst Goal 5 aims at achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls.","Contraception; Family Planning; Mali; Reproductive Health; Unmet Need; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Birth Control; Child; Contraception; Contraceptive Behavior; Controlled Study; Decision Making; Demography; Family Planning; Female; Gender Equity; Health Survey; Human; Human Experiment; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mali; Maternal Welfare; Middle Aged; Reproductive Health; Sustainable Development Goal; Wellbeing; Health Care Delivery; Human Rights; Contraception; Contraception Behavior; Family Planning Services; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Human Rights; Humans","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136931261"

It is important to explore this area of their lives as academics constantly face changes in terms of scope and workload. They also form the foundation of institutions of higher education. This research was done to explore where these institutes of higher education stand in terms of achieving SDG goal number 3, which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, for their academics through exploring academic lives and well-being. SDG or Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), refers to one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The reputation and success of institutes of higher education lie fundamentally in the work of its academics so any significant disruption to their health and well-being will have a negative impact on their quality of work and their organisation’s performance. This study revealed a negative impact of changes to the academics’ work-life-balance and the failure of their organisations to achieve SDG goal no 3. A qualitative approach using in-depth interviewing was used to interview nine academics, from different institutes of higher education in Melbourne, Australia. The informants included male and female academics from high and low-ranked institutes of higher education, of different positions and ages. This research used convenience and snowball sampling methods. The findings showed that the majority of informants were overworked with no clear breaks for holidays or weekends. The exception was 2 informants who enjoyed good work-life balance and holidays which may be due to their positions as Deans and Head of Programme. While mental health in education has been mainly focused on students, this research has revealed that the mental health of academics from these institutes is at a critical level and needs to be addressed.","Academic; Mental Health; Sdg Goal Number 3; Work-life Balance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008569543"

Mobile phone ownership (MPO) can play a key role in bridging this digital divide and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”, “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”, and “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. Administrative district-level infrastructural and societal readiness to women's MPO in rural settings of Bangladesh may also influence the geospatial variation in their MPO status, which is still unexplained. In the context of rural Bangladesh, household heads substantially exert influence over women's decision-making process. However, the role of household heads' age and education on women's MPO is mostly unexplored. As in developing countries, women's MPO does not ensure its usage, investigating the possibilities of women's MPO on its usage has immense importance. Therefore, this study aims to revisit the correlates of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh and explain the administrative district-level geospatial variation in their MPO by controlling the effect of individual and household-level sociodemographic correlates of MPO. Further, this study attempts to investigate the possibilities of MPO on the extent of its usage. This study used the latest nationally representative cross-sectional data from Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019. This study reveals that the district-level readiness was a potential source of geospatial variation in the prevalence of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh. The lowest level of readiness was noticed in north-western Bangladesh. Comparatively elderly women with better education and media exposure had a considerably higher chance of MPO. Elderly household heads, especially male and less educated heads, hindered the MPO of women. This study identified MPO as a key determinant of its extent of usage. Moreover, to increase the MPO by a faster pace, strategies should target less empowered women, particularly those who lived in districts of lower readiness.","Determinants; Digital Divide; Empowerment; Geospatial Heterogeneity; Mobile Phone; Rural Bangladesh; Decision Making; Developing Countries; Bangladesh; Determinant; Digital Divide; Empowerment; Geo-spatial; Geospatial Heterogeneity; Information And Communication Technologies; Multilevels; Rural Bangladesh; Rural Women; Cellular Telephones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121907208"

But any business management option has to be grounded in a true awareness or belief that it will be a suitable and appropriate choice. In this belief the personal values of those who have the power to lead the way to weigh heavily. In this sense, there are personal values that, when used as guidelines in the management of a company, seem to promote the happiness of employees in the work environment. The purpose of this paper is to find the personal values of the entrepreneur. As a secondary objective, the authors also study whether these values are associated with certain entrepreneurs’ socio-demographic factors (gender and age). Design/methodology/approach: The group to be studied is the Spanish business community. An exploratory study is carried out, first, with the definition of value constructs according to Schwartz’s personal values model and, second, with a relational analysis, measuring association effects through logistic regression. Findings: Two higher-order personal values of the entrepreneur are found that seem to contain all the elements that would lead to management styles that would facilitate happiness at work. These values emerge from a dimension model of Schwartz’s theory of basic human values. MVP which, however, does not follow its four adjacent/antagonistic dimensions, but is composed of three dimensions adjacent to each other and, therefore, complementary. Moreover, some stereotypes in the literature on the relationships between personal values and certain socio-demographic factors are broken down and their effects on happiness at work are revealed. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this work is the relatively small sample size. In this sense, it would be useful to check whether the overall results are repeated in larger samples. Another limitation is that this is a portrait of the group at a given time. Given the experimental nature of this type of work, especially in the case of socio-demographic factors, it would be advisable to carry out a follow-up longitudinal analysis with a time horizon. This would allow a more precise investigation of the effects of the variables mentioned above. In addition, a third limitation is that the authors are studying the collective of Spanish entrepreneurs, and in the study of personal values, culture has a determining influence (Schenck, 2016; Boer and Boehnke, 2016; Perozo and Paz, 2016). It would also be worthwhile considering this study by sector: are the values the same for entrepreneurs in different sectors?; or in some specific sectors, for example, are there differences between entrepreneurs with tech businesses versus non-tech businesses or those who make the circular economy or the green economy a guideline for their organizations? Thus, technology companies must be open to change. Openness and innovation are for their entrepreneurs’ key values to ensure their performance (Tseng, 2010; Van Auken et al., 2008). However, in these organizations, there is a framework of conflicting values between the required flexibility and the values of power and control that the entrepreneur needs, and wants, to have (Albarracín et al., 2014). On the other hand, personal values determine green self-identity and moderate its relationships with ecological care and the moral obligation of the entrepreneur (Blankenberg and Alhusen, 2019; Barbarossa et al., 2017). Therefore, it could be analysed whether these values are maintained in entrepreneurs in these sectors, influencing, as discussed in this paper, greater happiness in the work context; and whether they are conditioned by gender or age (Fotieva, 2021; Li et al., 2020). It would also be helpful to study the socio-demographic influence further, to analyse the possibility of interaction or confounding effects between socio-demographic variables and some other variables not addressed in this paper. For example, does purchasing power or income level, affect personal values? And do the values that give content to F2, power and control, lead the entrepreneur to a higher level of income level or vice versa? Do other factors play a role? In fact, for Hirigoyen (2008), values such as altruism, benevolence and universalism are considered as obstacles to the development of the company. Subsequently, authors such as Salas-Vallina (2018) and Boubakary (2015) conclude that far from that idea, these axiological elements would lead to more significant business development through the satisfaction and happiness they generate in employees and stimulate their productivity, matching with the conclusions. It would be interesting, as a complement to the approach of this work, to carry out a study on the happiness at work of the entrepreneur’s employees, being the group of employees surveyed. Knowing the profile of values of an entrepreneur through the scale proposed in this work, it would be possible to analyse whether this is associated with greater or lesser perceived happiness among his/her employees. As mentioned above, from the methodological point of view, a risk of using the multidimensional scaling modelling for the analysis of personal values is that the respondent reflects more what he/she considers socially desirable than his/her true perception. This bias is one of the main limitations of psychological research. However, the fact that European Statistical Office surveys are guided by experts, both in processing -knowing how to deal with social desirability in personal values research (Danioni and Barni, 2020) – and in data collection, eliminates this limitation. Practical implications: However, despite the above limitations, this paper makes important contributions. On the one hand, at a theoretical and instrumental level, it shows that the higher-order values graph of Spanish entrepreneurs follows the circumplex essence of the Schwartz value model but does not obey its number of higher-order dimensions. In the case of entrepreneurs, it consists of three elements, three dimensions, adjacent and complementary. None of them contradicts any other. A methodology is created to portray the Spanish entrepreneur in an axiological way and, from this portrait, to reveal his/her tendency towards a leadership style that promotes the happiness of his/her employees, through the importance given to these three factors or dimensions. These dimensions are weighted, in turn, by issues such as gender or age group. For added practical purposes, this information would be beneficial, in the first place, for all those who want to work in and with a particular entrepreneur. The type of leadership or management expected is a factor or reason why a person decides where he/she would like to work (Qing et al., 2020; Lee, 2016). This is not only for the potential employees of that business but also for all those groups or stakeholders, who engage with the company to perform their functions. Individuals make important decisions and choices about their relationships in the work environment based on the alignment of their values with those of the party they want to engage with (Sagiv et al., 2015). On the other hand, it can serve entrepreneurship educators. By knowing the value factors of entrepreneurs, adjusted to the culture of the particular territory, they will be able to pass on this information to their entrepreneurship students (Karimi and Makreet, 2020; Arieli and Tenne-Gazit, 2017) and teach them how they could increase the happiness at work. It also serves to better understand the constructs of management values-employee engagement-workplace happiness in the current environment (Ravina-Ripoll et al., 2020; Salas-Vallina et al., 2017; Wang and Yang, 2016), by introducing the role of personal values on the entrepreneur’s governance style into this construct (Figure 1). Social implications: Finally, this study can also have social implications, making its tiny contribution to the SDGs through the study of personal values that guide the behaviour of the entrepreneur. The decision by international institutions for countries to implement the sustainable development goals (SDGs) (UNSDG 2030 Agenda) as cross-cutting strands of their policies has boosted the idea of addressing happiness at work. Thus, SDG 8 talks about Decent Work. In addition to the priority of improving the conditions of groups living in discriminatory working environments (child labour, poverty, precariousness, etc.), taken to its maximum expression, this objective encompasses much more. Workers spend a large part of their lives at work. At the same time, a business needs its employees to be productive. SDG 8 aims to ensure that people have quality employment, increasing their productivity and consumption potential. On the other hand, SDG 3 is about “Health and Well-being”, i.e. ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages. It is also about health and well-being in the work environment. Issues such as interpersonal relationships at work, environment and teams, organizational culture, role in the organization, autonomy at work and fostering innovative spirit, can be factors that, if poorly managed, reduce the feeling or perception of happiness at work, especially in today’s digital world (Foncubierta-Rodríguez and Montero-Sánchez, 2019; Leka and Houdmont, 2010; Näswall et al., 2008). Originality/value: The role of certain higher-order personal values of the entrepreneur is highlighted, which could make him/her tend towards the realization of happiness management practices. Furthermore, through the methodology used, a model of the entrepreneur’s higher-order values has been established, which can be used as a tool to generate reasonable expectations about his/her way of governance and to what extent it is close to a framework conducive to happiness management. This information can be beneficial to all those people and groups that establish relationships with the company, from managers and employees to external stakeholders. In this way, it also helps to anticipate the companýs response to corporate social responsibility.","Age; Corporate Governance; Entrepreneurs; Gender; Happiness Management; Personal Values","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119018196"

It also explores the extent to which health conditions influence the meaning in life in late career. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 1,330 Portuguese-based individuals aged 55–75 years. The structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for the data analysis and to test the research questions. Findings: The results showed that stress and burnout are influenced by work demands and organization, job content, leadership and values in the workplace. Employment status had no influence. Health status affects the meaning in life.

A healthy city is a sustainable city that interacts with its environment, economy, population, services, and space, and realizes the wellbeing of its population from all perspectives. The construction of a healthy city is an important part of the transformation of Chinese urbanization. This article refers to the index systems of domestic and foreign government agencies, along with a literature research, to construct a healthy city evaluation index that takes into account the five aspects of environment, economy, population, service, and space, and selects Beijing (a policy-oriented city), Shanghai (an economy-oriented city), Nanchang (an industry-oriented city), Guiyang (a tourism-oriented city), Datong (resource-oriented city) as five cities according to type of urban development, using the entire-array-polygon method to analyze the construction level of these cities in terms of environment, economy, population, service, space and overall state of health from 2014 to 2018 based on statistical and land use data. The results of the study found that, in general, the construction of healthy cities in China currently experiences large year-toyear fluctuations and significant differences between cities. The construction and development of healthy cities are also closely related to factors such as urban economic strength, social welfare, and policy support.","Entire-array-polygon Method; Sustainable Development; Urban Health Assessment; Construction; Land Use; Polygon; Statistical Data; Sustainable Development; Transformation; United Nations; Urban Development; Beijing [china]; China; Datong; Guiyang; Guizhou; Jiangxi; Nanchang; Shanghai; Shanxi; World","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125364446"

Disaster can lead to a loss in lives, livelihoods, and health and severely impact the economic, physical, social, cultural, and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities, and countries. All disasters are a health issue, impacting the health of the population and bringing about substantial losses and disruption to health systems. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is essential for sustainable social and economic development. In 2015 the United Nations released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2030 Agenda for SDGs recognizes and reaffirms the urgent need to reduce the risk of disasters. The Sendai Framework for DRR 2015–2030 highlights the concern on human health and well-being that are common to DRR, climate change, and sustainable development (Sendai Framework for DRR 2015–2030). Sendai Framework and SDGs are frequently interlinked. Health has a central place in SDG 3 among 17 goals. SDG 3 states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Other SDGs such as education, food, water, sanitation, environmental gender discrimination, and abuse are social determinants of health that are also linked with health of people. With the additional knowledge and skills of epidemiology, and DRR, EpiNurse can play an important role to achieve these SDGs. Since EpiNurse seeks to help people to achieve optimum health, their work has a significant impact on SDGs. The Nepal Government has also set the targets and indicators for SDGs. The proposed SDG 3 targets include reduction of maternal mortality rate to less than 70 per 100 thousand live births, reduction of preventable death of newborn and children to less than one percent, and almost elimination of the prevalence of HIV, TB, malaria and other tropical diseases, and waterborne diseases by 2030. To achieve these targets of SDGs in Nepal, the role of EpiNurse nurses is crucial while disasters exist. EpiNurse refers to local nurses who perform epidemiological surveillance and care to ensure human health security and communicate with health authorities on the health status of communities during and after disasters. The aim of EpiNurse is to identify the potential health threats associated with different kinds of disasters in the community; and reduce such health risks as much as possible by using information and communication technology (ICT) based on the Sendai Framework for DRR. Participatory health assessment and monitoring, providing direct care, epidemiological surveillance and reporting, and communicating to authorities to ensure health security are the main roles of EpiNurse. The incorporation of ICT and epidemiological approach with nursing is an innovative approach. This approach can play an important role to meet the SDG targets. The aim of this article is to discuss the EpiNurse, emerging care, communication, and health monitoring during disasters.","Disaster; Epidemiological Surveillance; Epinurse; Hedrm; Sdg","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195110297"

Drawing on the World Health Organisations’ (WHO) global strategy and action plan on Ageing and Health, this chapter examines how strategic objectives of the plan have manifested in the Nepalese policy landscape in relation to the third SDG - ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. The findings indicate that integrating the AHA agenda into social policies and programs at the country level has been hindered by the lack of: (a) an emphasis on age-friendly environment; (b) an alignment of health systems to the needs of elderly, (c) support for private and not-for-profit sector-led geriatric care initiatives, and (d) initiatives to support and fund research on AHA.","Age Friendly Environments; Ageing And Health; Covid-19; Healthy Ageing; Long Term Care; Policy Analysis; South Asia; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166096816"

From the methods for demonstrating virtual environments in the laboratory, to the methods for studying psychological and physiological responses in actual urban nature, these are the means used to validate the relationship between “nature and health benefits.” In the previous chapter, we explored theories of nature and people. Based on evolution and psycho-physiological concepts, it appears that people prefer nature with specific characteristics that provide “something” good for them, either by supporting their living needs, setting their cognitive ability to a good emotional state, or by making them feel satisfied. In this chapter, we selected the methods for performing health benefit experiments, psychological scales for collecting human responses in different environments, and physiological instruments used to record people’s responses in order to verify these theories from another perspective, including empirical research to conceive readers that nature provides better health benefits than urban. The following existing tools for examining the psychological to physical responses in each section contains a brief introduction of the methods or tools, the operation process and indicators of each apparatus, and relevant researches that lead us to think about what those selective review of tools and concepts in psychological and physiological human response-to-nature researches could support the SDGs on Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and Goal 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable).

Generally, stigma and policies against men who have sex with men have heightened the risk of getting and spreading sexually transmitted diseases in this key population. This study, therefore, sought to explore men who have sex with men's perceptions and experiences of sexual and reproductive health services offered in Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Methods: An exploratory, descriptive qualitative study was conducted on twenty-four (24) purposively selected men who had sex with men identified through Sexual Rights Centre in Bulawayo. The study participants responded to unstructured interview questions that probed on their lived experiences and perceptions of sexual and reproductive health services offered by health facilities in the city of Bulawayo. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and thematically analyzed on MAXQDA Version 20 Pro. Results: Findings suggested that men who had sex with men sought a wider range of sexual and reproductive health services that ranged from voluntary counseling and testing, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, and obtaining pre-exposure prophylaxis tablets, among other issues. However, men who had sex with men faced discrimination, stigma, and hostile treatment by some health service providers. This scenario, in some instances, is perceived to have fueled their vulnerability and led to internalized homophobia. Conclusion: In pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal Number 3, which challenges all nations to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages, men who have sex with men are not fully accorded their rights. Therefore, there is a need to reorient health services and align policies to ensure the inclusion of this key population in accessing and utilizing sexual and reproductive health services.","Access; Bisexual Men; Experiences; Gay Men; Perceptions; Sexual And Reproductive Health Services; Article; Bisexual Male; Health Care Facility; Health Care Personnel; Health Service; Homophobia; Human; Men Who Have Sex With Men; Perception; Prophylaxis; Qualitative Research; Reproductive Health; Sexual Health; Sexual Orientation; Sexually Transmitted Disease; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141214961"

This review aimed to assess the replacement of plastic usage with a better alternative, including studies on various types of cutlery, preparation of edible cutlery, therapeutical properties and the market of edible cutlery.They occur in everyday life, which compromises the standard of living. Plastic usage can be minimized with a better alternative, as complete eradication is not possible due to their consistent dependence and usage. So, a better substitute is cutlery made up of plantbased products like rice, sorghum, wheat, soy, and rice bran flour. The edible cutlery has biodegradable and eco-friendly properties and is the finest substitute for plastic cutlery. This cutlery can help change the system of unhealthiness into a better lifestyle by minimizing the health-associated risks such as cancers, endocrine disruption, and impaired immunity with exposure to leaching plastic packages which are used to store food items.

UHC aims to provide everyone with equal access to quality essential and comprehensive healthcare services including preventions, interventions, and treatments, without exposing them to financial hardship. Making progress toward UHC requires significant investment in technical and financial resources and countries are pursuing the implementation of cost-saving measures within health systems to help them achieve UHC. Whilst many countries are far from attaining UHC, all countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, can take steps toward achieving UHC. This paper discusses key data showing how immunization is a fundamental, cost-effective tool for reducing morbidity and mortality associated with infectious disease in all populations, creating more productive communities, reducing treatment costs, and consequently, facilitating social and economic advancement. Immunization is key to advancing toward UHC by relieving the burden that diseases place on the healthcare services, freeing essential resources to use elsewhere within the healthcare system. Immunization is an essential, readily available strategy that countries can deploy to achieve UHC and the SDG3 agenda.","Healthcare; Immunization; Public Health; Universal Health Coverage; Vaccination; Adult; Cerebrovascular Accident; Child; Childhood Mortality; Cholera; Communicable Disease; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Disease Burden; Disease Transmission; Female; Health Care Cost; Health Care Delivery; Health Care Facility; Health Care Personnel; Health Care System; Heart Infarction; Human; Immunization; Immunosenescence; Incidence; Infection Risk; Life Expectancy; Maternal Mortality; Morbidity; Mortality; Non Communicable Disease; Note; Pneumonia; Prevalence; Quality Of Life; Vaccination; Vaccination Coverage; Income; Child; Delivery Of Health Care; Health Care Costs; Humans; Immunization; Income; Universal Health Insurance","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126021054"

Now, more than seven decades later, Acta Tropica is a trusted outlet to communicate and disseminate scientific advances in the fields of parasitology and tropical medicine. As a scholarly, peer-reviewed journal, Acta Tropica contributes to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, that is “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all of all ages”. This article explores how Acta Tropica has evolved over time. Our analysis is based on a systematic review of keywords derived from all issues published in a specific year, arbitrarily selected at decadal snapshots (1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). Results indicate a decrease in interdisciplinarity in favour of more specialised expertise in various fields of infectious diseases research and public health with a particular emphasis on low- and middle-income countries. Yet, by examining first and last authors’ institutional affiliations and classifying countries by the Human Development Index (HDI), we find that most authors are affiliated with institutions in high- and very high-HDI countries. Over time, the mean number of authors on a paper has increased severalfold (from 1.35 in 1950 to 7.51 in 2020). Taken together, Acta Tropica has become increasingly globally anchored and contributes not only to SDG 3, but increasingly also to SDG 17, that is “Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development”.","Acta Tropica; Bibliometric Analysis; Human Development Index; Institutional Affiliations; Parasitology; Sustainable Development Goals; Tropical Medicine; Bibliography; Developing World; Human Development Index; Infectious Disease; Institutional Framework; Literature Review; Parasitology; Public Health; Research Work; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Article; Bibliometrics; Life Expectancy; Low Income Country; Middle Income Country; Tropical Medicine; Health Status; Human; Motivation; Health Status; Humans; Motivation; Public Health; Sustainable Development; Tropical Medicine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117710489"

This article studies how armed conflict impacts immunization rates among children, combining two large datasets. We use health data for 15 conflict-affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including multiple Demographic and Health Survey rounds for most. We exploit the fact that age-appropriate vaccinations should take place in the child's first year of life and compare children aged one to five with varying degrees of (local) conflict exposure in their first year of life within the same countries and communities. We differentiate between the effects of local and country-level exposure to conflict on childhood immunization rates. The regression results show that conflict has a nonmonotonic effect on vaccination rates with minor (major) conflicts being associated with higher (lower) full immunization rates. We argue that in the case of minor conflicts, local-level health care access drives the results, whereas for major conflicts it is mainly national channels that drive the result.","Accessibility; Child Health; Health Care; Health Services; Immunization; Public Health; Service Provision; Social Conflict; Sustainable Development Goal; Sub-saharan Africa","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119842959"

This article explores adolescents’ access to health services in the Gaza Strip, and their experiences and perceptions of those services. Methods: The article draws on mixed methods research in the Gaza Strip conducted in 2016 and 2017 as part of the Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence research programme. Data were collected from 240 male and female adolescents combining in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a tablet-based survey. This study also draws on a participatory action pilot project engaging 12 boys and 23 adolescent girls aged 15–19 years old. Results: The findings underscore that gender norms—especially those pertaining to adolescent girls’ sexual purity––shape adolescent health in multiple ways. Girls face increasing restrictions on their mobility, leaving them with limited opportunities for leisure or exercise, socializing with peers or seeking health services and information. Adolescent boys in Gaza do not face the same restrictions, but given the multiple political, economic and familial stressors, they are at high risk of substance abuse including smoking and involvement in peer violence. Moreover, our findings suggest that a range of socioeconomic, cultural and structural barriers prevent adolescents in Gaza from accessing quality and appropriate health care. Study participants cited the main challenges being an absence of preventive adolescent health initiatives and limited information on sexual and reproductive health, as well as drug shortages, high treatment costs, and inappropriate interactions with service providers. Conclusions: The article highlights the importance of designing and implementing conflict-sensitive and age- and gender-appropriate adolescent services and information and promoting preventive services targeted at adolescents.","Adolescence; Conflict; Gaza; Gender Norms; Sexual And Reproductive Health","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106874748"

Use of unregistered herbal medicines has the potential of causing adverse health effects to the mother and the newborn, thus deterring achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. One of the targets is on reduction of morbidity and mortality among mothers and newborns. This study investigated use of herbal medicines and predictors of usage during pregnancy or delivery as a forgotten exposure towards understanding some of the challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3. Methods: This cross-sectional quantitative study gathered information from women who delivered a live-born baby in the preceding two years. Using a two-stage-sampling technique, women attending reproductive, maternal and child health clinics in Tabora were selected and interviewed. Proportions were compared using chi-square test and Poisson regression analysis was performed to determine independent correlates of herbal medicine use. Results: Of 340 recruited women, 208 [61.2 %; 95 % confidence interval: 55.4, 66.3 %] used herbal medicines during pregnancy or delivery. Major reasons for use included accelerating labour, 81 (38.9 %) and reducing labour pains, 58 (27.9 %). Women who made less than four antenatal visits had a 24 % higher adjusted prevalence ratio of using herbal medicines as compared to those who had at least four visits [adjusted prevalence ratio:1.24; 95 % confidence interval: 1.02, 1.50, p = 0.03]. Furthermore, the adjusted prevalence ratio of using herbal medicines was 35 % higher among women who were not discouraged by health care providers against their use as compared to those who were discouraged (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.35; 95 % confidence interval: 1.13, 1.60, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Use of herbal medicines during pregnancy or delivery among women in Tanzania is common. Independent predictors of herbal medicine use were number of antenatal visits and stance of maternity health care providers on their use. Comprehensive investigations on the magnitude, patterns and predictors of use of herbal medicines during pregnancy or delivery are warranted.","Herbal Medicine; Pregnancy; Sustainable Development Goal 3; Tanzania; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Correlational Study; Cross-sectional Study; Female; Health Care Personnel; Herbal Medicine; Human; Interview; Labor; Labor Pain; Obstetric Delivery; Prediction; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure; Prevalence; Quantitative Study; Sustainable Development; Tanzania; Adverse Event; African Medicine; Live Birth; Middle Aged; Motivation; Newborn; Phytotherapy; Pregnancy Complication; Prenatal Care; Procedures; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Goals; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Labor, Obstetric; Live Birth; Medicine, African Traditional; Middle Aged; Phytotherapy; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Care; Prevalence; Sustainable Development; Young Adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103807918"

For various such diseases, the deployment of mobile screening teams forms an important instrument to reduce prevalence toward elimination targets. There is considerable variety in planning methods for the deployment of these mobile teams in practice, but little understanding of their effectiveness. Moreover, there appears to be little understanding of the relationship between the number of mobile teams and progress toward the goals. This research considers capacity planning and deployment of mobile screening teams for one such neglected tropical disease: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness). We prove that the deployment problem is strongly NP-Hard and propose three approaches to find (near) optimal screening plans. For the purpose of practical implementation in remote rural areas, we also develop four simple policies. The performance of these methods and their robustness is benchmarked for a HAT region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Two of the four simple practical policies yield near optimal solutions, one of which also appears robust against parameter impreciseness. We also present a simple approximation of prevalence as a function of screening capacity, which appears rather accurate for the case study. While the results may serve to more effectively allocate funding and deploy mobile screening capacity, they also indicate that mobile screening may not suffice to achieve HAT elimination.","Active Case Finding; Human African Trypanosomiasis; Infectious Diseases; Mobile Teams; Optimization; Planning; Screening","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107302710"

This article sought to examine how ecological zone interacts with other socio-demographic characteristics to influence health insurance coverage among adolescent girls in Ghana. Subjects and methods: The study used data from the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey. A sample size of 3767 adolescent girls was used for this study. This study employed both descriptive and inferential analytical approaches to analyze the data using STATA version 14.0. Results: The study found that ecological zone has a statistically significant association with health insurance coverage among adolescent girls in Ghana, with adolescent girls in the Northern Zone less likely to be covered by health insurance than those in the Coastal Zone [AOR = 0.76, CI = 0.58–0.98]. Other factors that determined health insurance coverage among adolescent girls in Ghana were age, parity, education level and marital status. Conclusion: With adolescent girls in the Northern Zone less likely to be covered by health insurance, it is unlikely that Ghana will be able to achieve equity in healthcare even with the existence of health insurance. If this situation persists, the ability of the country to work towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, which seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, is under threat.","Adolescent Girls; Ecological Zone; Ghana; Health Insurance Coverage; Adolescent; Article; Child; Coastal Waters; Controlled Study; Education; Female; Financial Management; Ghana; Health Insurance; Human; Human Experiment; Major Clinical Study; Marriage; Maternal Welfare; Middle Income Country; Parity; Sample Size; Sustainable Development; Wellbeing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077586852"

They are key agents in the education of future leaders that will contribute to the successful United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation. The geography of SDGs this implementation is very heterogeneous, but it is clear that higher education institutions contribute decisively to creating a mindset that facilitates the dissemination of SDGs principle. This perspective paper analyses the impacts of higher education on sustainability and the challenges and barriers associated with this process. Higher education contributes decisively to the SDGs implementation, but especially to Goal 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere), Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), Goal 5 (gender equality), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (climate change) and Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). As a transformational agent, the higher education sector has a tremendous impact on students' habit and contribution to a prosperous society. However, to establish the required change in education, sustainability principles need to be at the heart of higher institutions strategy (e.g., curricula, modus operandi) and is key to be incorporated in the organisational culture. Only by leading by example, the external influence in the society will be possible (e.g., implementing SDGs key aspects such as gender quality, reduce waste reduction and energy consumption). For this to be a reality, different communication methods with students are needed (e.g., different student academic levels). Nevertheless, critical challenges need to be tackled in the institutions inside and outside the institution environment, such as incorporating sustainability principles, political environment and stakeholders' interest.","Communication; Higher Education Institutions; Organisational Culture; Sustainability; Communication; Higher Education; Organization; Student; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110365521"

Different tools have been developed for this purpose: the Aura Method and the Aura Matrix. The Aura Matrix of relationships built from the SDGs, along with the conceptual proposals to which the project must respond, allows for the definition of a methodological framework of action, defined as the Aura Method, applicable to any project that aims to respond to the urban scale from a more sustainable and healthy approach and within the framework of the above-mentioned goals.

The scope of the 2019 proposal based on the use of these tools is more rigorous and bold with respect to the requirements defined by the SDGs than the 2015 proposal, based on the millennium goals. This reinforces to a great extent the resilience of the urban scope under study and its capacity to face serious situations in terms of citizens’ health, such as the pandemic we are currently suffering, and improves life quality.

Jordan has steadily improved health standards through establishing a health system composed of hospitals, health centers, and medical schools. Although Jordan has realized great achievements in the health field, the country still faces many challenges to achieve the SDG 3 including increasing pressure on Jordan’s health system because of the influx of refugees from Syria, the lack of long-term data to observe the temporal evolution of the implemented indicators, and the lack of financial resources in Jordan to carry out and plan sustainable development. However, it is expected that Jordan will likely achieve a better health standard by 2030 if the country adheres to and monitors SDG targets.","Health Status; Jordan; Targets; The Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161121557"

It will also be important to expand support to initiatives that build health across multiple social-ecological scales (e.g. the health of soil microbes, human bodies, communities, and the planet as a whole). Such approaches do not necessarily emerge within the health care sector, and can include social movements that shift meaning frameworks and create innovative ways of living that build resilience in populations. The chapter uses examples of soil health, care farming, and family care for mental health to further these points.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136416789"

This study intends to examine the influence of three Indian meditation practices, i.e., Vipassana mindfulness meditation, Raja Yoga and Sudarshan Kriya Yoga, by employing a cross-sectional design. 168 healthy adults-84 meditators (n=28 for each practice) and 84 non-meditators – had voluntarily participated. Meditators reported significantly higher subjective well-being (satisfaction with life, positive affect), psychological well-being (flourishing), presence of meaning in life, and character strengths (hope, gratitude, curiosity, zest and love), and significantly lower negative affect as compared to non-meditators. The medium to large effect sizes (Cohen’s d:.572 to.955), except for zest, were marked with a significant association (rp: |.245 to.487|, p<.05) with the duration of meditation, thereby signifying enhanced benefits of sustained practice. 60.2% of the variance in flourishing was explained by satisfaction in life, positive affect, hope, gratitude and presence of meaning. These evidence-based universal practices accessible across the globe and acceptable to people of all ages and backgrounds are worthy targets of rigorous research, adoption at the workplace and widespread dissemination to further SDG 3 – ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.’.","Character Strengths; Flourishing; Raja Yoga; Sudarshan Kriya Yoga; Vipassana Mindfulness Meditation; Well-being","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133162549"

It discusses maternal health as a right and its implications for achieving SDG 3, titled ‘Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-being for all at all Ages.' This goal requires, among other things, that adequate attention be given to reproductive health and its incorporation into national policies. The current state of maternal health reveals that Nigeria is far from achieving SDG 3, largely due to the biosocial issues that have remained unaddressed for decades. In addition, the legal regime for the protection of human rights falls short of the standards required to ensure maternal health gets the attention that it deserves. Hence, the chapter examines relevant legal provisions with a view to advocating that maternal health be treated as a basic human right. The chapter uses the prevalence of vesicovaginal fistula among women in northern Nigeria as an example of the relationship between maternal health and socio-economic and cultural issues. Therefore, the chapter recommends ways to control maternal health problems in Nigeria. An important measure will be to make provision for recognizable and enforceable maternal health rights in Nigeria","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130956461"

Cross-sectional study of a descriptive type, with a quali-quantitative approach, conducted from bibliographic review on health governance in the view of the control organs, was carried out through a survey (LimeSurvey® tool) of national scope, involving the 27 Brazilian state health councils. The results revealed that 67% of the state health councils do not provide transparency adequately and, of these, six do not provide any type of transparency; 37% do not provide accountability for the implementation and results of the state health plan; 52% do not investigate the irregularities practiced by the state health secretariats, nor do they promote accountability; only 4% provide transparency with improved maturity; and 7% have improved accountability both for accounting for the implementation and results of the state health plan and for ensuring accountability for proven irregularities. It was concluded that the performance of state health councils in relation to transparency and accountability hinders the access to public health information, favors corruption, does not improve public management, and does not encourage popular participation and social control, which distances us from Sustainable Development Goals-3: “Health and Well-Being: ensure a healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages”.","Accountability; State Health Councils; Transparency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128811145"

Achieving the third Sustainable Development Goal: “Ensure Healthy Lives and promote Well-being for all at all ages” since the end of 2019 is a big question mark to most of the economies. The first Case of Covid-19 was found in China during the mid of November 2019, still now there is no proper medicine and vaccine were found to cure fully. The vaccination availed after one year also not resulting 100% and the modern medicine there is no satisfactory effective therapy available to cure the Covid-19 infection due to the less genetic information regarding the mutation of this virus. World Health Organization suggested to implement Lock downs to handle this pandemic. Upto the end of first month of this decade more than 100 million people were infected and more than 2 million people were lost their lives. This pandemic severely affected most economic sectors of the world without any partiality. This attempt was made to analyze the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the Maritime Education sector and Shipping Industry. For the study purpose detailed survey was conducted among the Maritime students, educators, sailors and practitioners in the different parts of the world. Collection of qualitative data for this study is quite difficult due to pandemic. So present study adopts descriptive cum analytical research design was adopted for the study. Totally 1094 respondents of the 16 countries were approached for the study purpose and received the responses from 857 respondents were responded to the survey and results were documented here to understand the future of the Maritime industry. The results of the study are interesting and highlighted the present mentality and economic status of mariners and future of the students. Mariners reported that they have less sailing opportunities compared to the past. Many of the respondents were worried that this economic slowdown due to pandemic had a huge impact on the industry is terms of less Liner schedules and reduced employment opportunities and poor practical exposure. Maritime Students highlighted that they were unable to get the practical exposures to meet out the challenges and virtual education system gave less chances to learn the practical aspects. Maritime educators pointed that less interaction between the students resulted in terms of adverse results. Meanwhile few of them responded that this pandemic helps them in terms of increased business growth in absence of Air Cargos. This study suggests that both public and private sector should take initiatives to meet out the challenges of this changes in the Maritime sector. Maritime Education institutions have to revise their mandatory policies to meet out the changing trends in education sector. It concludes that both positive and negative aspects of this pandemic resulted the tremendous changes in the Maritime sector hugely in reduced possibilities in the economies of the maritime business ventures. Further, this study suggests future researchers to carry out the segment specific both qualitative and analytical studies to handle the pandemic situation to effectively meet out the needs of the sector for the sustainability.","Covid-19; Mariners; Maritime Education; Shipping Industry; Curing; Genes; Industrial Economics; Marine Industry; Ships; Surveys; Vaccines; Viruses; Covid-19; Education Institutions; Education Sectors; Effective Therapy; Mariner; Maritime Education; Maritime Sector; Modern Medicine; Shipping Industry; Well Being; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124620820"

Nearly about 2 million of cases of diarrhea occur annually in India. An average Indian child below 5 years of age can have 2-3 episodes of diarrhea. It contributes to nearly 2.1 million of the global burden of 9.7 million under five deaths, which is the highest for any nation in the world. The Millennium Development Goal 4 aimed at reducing under-five mortality by two-third till year 2015 which remained unachieved and sustainable development goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages including under-five children by the year 2030. The health and treatment-seeking behavior of parents and caregivers has direct reflection over child survival statistics of India. The present study has been conducted to study the determinants of treatment-seeking behavior of families for illness of under-five children in the field practice area of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC), Sawangi, Wardha, Maharashtra, India. Aims: A study on the treatment-seeking behaviors of families for illnesses of under-five children in field practice area of JNMC, Wardha, Maharashtra, India. Objectives: The objective of this study is to know the treatment-seeking behaviors of families for under-five children in rural areas. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out in the field practice area of community medicine JNMC, Sawangi Wardha, Maharashtra, India. The present study was carried out in the adopted villages from the field practice area of Wardha district by the JNMC. The present study was a community-based, cross-sectional study, and the study period was 6 months (i.e., from July 2019 to December 2019).The study participants comprised of the caregivers of children under-5 years of age and including mothers and other family members who were primarily responsible for attending the child's health. All children in the age group of 0 to 5 years from the study area were identified for the same (from Anganwadi's in the villages). The study participants, i.e., parents who were ready to participate in the study by signing the written consent were included in the study. Statistical Analysis Used: A predesigned and prestructured questionnaire was prepared and implemented for data collection. Results: The results showed that most of the under-five children were in the age group of 2-3 years. Most of the under-five children were having itching on skin followed by fever and diarrhea. Most of the parents took their under-five children to ANM's or the government hospital situated at their place. Conclusions: The present study concludes that treatment-seeking practices among parents for under-five children in the adopted villages of medical college are satisfactory in terms of qualified treatment provider and compliance to the treatment.","Field Practice Area; Morbidity Pattern; Treatment-seeking Behaviors; Treatment-seeking Practices Under-five Children","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111986030"

Drawing attention to the indoor environmental quality, thus the well-being of the occupants, means evaluating a building's impact on all 5 of the human senses. Hearing, acoustics, can easily be overlooked, but distracting sound can affect our bodies in more ways than we may realize. Buildings that provide a pleasant indoor acoustic environment, allow employees to be more productive, students to learn easier and hospital patients to recover quicker. A survey concluded that 75% of office employees list noise as an important workplace feature, yet only 30% are satisfied with the noise levels in their office. In schools, up to 70% of the consonants spoken by teachers cannot be heard by pupils. A survey of the countries in the EU, requested by the EC, showed that 80% of respondents believed that noise affects their health, either to some or to a great extent. Additionally, noisy environments increase physical and mental risks for example hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. As such, it links to SDG 3 ""Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"". (method) An analysis of the specific room acoustic requirements for open offices, which is the biggest building segment for green building schemes, and schools is the key component of the study. The analysis compares the quantitative requirements such as reverberation time and absorption area in 4 schemes (LEED, BREEAM, DGNB and WELL) to 8 national building regulations in Europe. As the building regulations only exist in their national languages these in depth comparisons are not common. (results & conclusions) This comparison shows that several schemes do not require the anyhow legally required thresholds whereas few schemes go beyond.","Acoustic Noise; Audition; Building Codes; Buildings; Indoor Air Pollution; Noise Pollution; Personnel; Reverberation; Smoke; Surveys; Sustainable Development; Building Regulations; Building Segments; Distracting Sounds; Indoor Environmental Quality; National Language; Noisy Environment; Reverberation Time; Secondhand Smokes; Architectural Acoustics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097190724"

It is based on an organizational ethnography of the VELUX Group and interviews from four business model innovation cases to illustrate how the industry can use SDG3 to create more sustainable and healthy buildings. The research finds that whereas SDG3 highlights the significance of human factors in the building industry, smart technologies support value creation based on formerly unmeasurable qualitative aspects like indoor health. Further, challenges to SDG3-based business model innovation underscore the need for expanded cross-sector collaboration in order to establish markets for the resultant smart, healthy building solutions.

Both of which are among the targets for the 3rd United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.As reported in the [ACM Special Interest Group in Computers and Society (SIGCAS) 2020 Computers and Sustainable Societies (COMPASS)] and [IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society (TEMS) 2020 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Good (AI4G)] Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are utilized by Santa Clara University's EPIC (Ethical, Pragmatic, and Intelligent Computing) and BioInnovation Design laboratories for continued research and development of an eVision (Epidemic Vision) tool to predict the trend of influenza cases throughout the flu season. There we reported eVision's success in making 3 to 7 weeks in advance predictions for the 2018-2019 United States flu season with 90.15% accuracy on 7 week predictions and delineated future steps of 1) expanding eVision's scope to study the effects of augmenting predictions with concurrent data from neighboring, near by, and developmentally similar countries/states with similar environmental conditions and 2) the introduction of confidence intervals for the predictions in order to account for the average error and thus increase the trustworthiness of eVision's results. This paper is to report that as a result of those steps, both the Californian and Chilean 7 week forecasts improved by 1.98% and 7.89% respectively.","Flu Trend Prediction; Google Trends; Health Care Technology; Influenza Incident Rate Forecasting; Long Short-term Memory (lstm) Neural Networks; Medical Machine Learning; Disease Control; Intelligent Computing; Intelligent Well Technology; Long Short-term Memory; Research And Development Management; Sustainable Development; Center For Disease Control And Preventions; Communicable Disease; Computers And Societies; Early Warning Mechanisms; Engineering Management; Environmental Conditions; Research And Development; Special Interest Groups; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101207626"

While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available. Methods: We estimated domestic health spending, disaggregated by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private) from 1995 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. For disease-specific health spending, we estimated spending for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis for 135 low-income and middle-income countries, and malaria in 106 malaria-endemic countries, from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030. We report all spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2019 US$, unless otherwise stated. Findings: Since the development and implementation of the SDGs in 2015, global health spending has increased, reaching $7·9 trillion (95% uncertainty interval 7·8–8·0) in 2017 and is expected to increase to $11·0 trillion (10·7–11·2) by 2030. In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was $20·2 billion (17·0–25·0) and on tuberculosis it was $10·9 billion (10·3–11·8), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was $5·1 billion (4·9–5·4). Development assistance for health was $40·6 billion in 2019 and HIV/AIDS has been the health focus area to receive the highest contribution since 2004. In 2019, $374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81·6% (81·6–81·7) in 2015 to 83·1% (82·8–83·3) in 2030. Interpretation: Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale-up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes. Although countries will probably need more resources to achieve SDG3, other constraints in the broader health system such as inefficient allocation of resources across interventions and populations, weak governance systems, human resource shortages, and drug shortages, will also need to be addressed.

Drawing attention to the indoor environmental quality, thus the well-being of the occupants, means evaluating a building's impact on all 5 of the human senses. Hearing, acoustics, can easily be overlooked, but distracting sound can affect our bodies in more ways than we may realize. Buildings that provide a pleasant indoor acoustic environment, allow employees to be more productive, students to learn easier and hospital patients to recover quicker. A survey concluded that 75% of office employees list noise as an important workplace feature, yet only 30% are satisfied with the noise levels in their office. In schools, up to 70% of the consonants spoken by teachers cannot be heard by pupils. A survey of the countries in the EU, requested by the EC, showed that 80% of respondents believed that noise affects their health, either to some or to a great extent. Additionally, noisy environments increase physical and mental risks for example hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. As such, it links to SDG 3 ""Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"". (method) An analysis of the specific room acoustic requirements for open offices, which is the biggest building segment for green building schemes, and schools is the key component of the study. The analysis compares the quantitative requirements such as reverberation time and absorption area in 4 schemes (LEED, BREEAM, DGNB and WELL) to 8 national building regulations in Europe. As the building regulations only exist in their national languages these in depth comparisons are not common. (results & conclusions) This comparison shows that several schemes do not require the anyhow legally required thresholds whereas few schemes go beyond.","Acoustic Noise; Acoustic Variables Control; Audition; Building Codes; Buildings; Indoor Air Pollution; Noise Pollution; Personnel; Reverberation; Smoke; Surveys; Building Regulations; Building Segments; Distracting Sounds; Indoor Environmental Quality; National Language; Noisy Environment; Reverberation Time; Secondhand Smokes; Architectural Acoustics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101345819"

The health system plays a key role in achieving these goals and must have sufficient human resources in order to provide care to the population according to their needs and expectations. Methods: This paper explores the issues of unemployment, underemployment, and labor wastage in physicians and nurses in Mexico, all of which serve as barriers to achieving universal health coverage. We conducted a descriptive, observational, and longitudinal study to analyze the rates of employment, underemployment, unemployment, and labor wastage during the period 2005-2017 by gender. We used data from the National Occupation and Employment Survey. Calculating the average annual rates (AAR) for the period, we describe trends of the calculated rates. In addition, for 2017, we calculated health workforce densities for each of the 32 Mexican states and estimated the gaps with respect to the threshold of 4.45 health workers per 1000 inhabitants, as proposed in the Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health. Results: The AAR of employed female physicians was lower than men, and the AARs of qualitative underemployment, unemployment, and labor wastage for female physicians are higher than those of men. Female nurses, however, had a higher AAR in employment than male nurses and a lower AAR of qualitative underemployment and unemployment rates. Both female physicians and nurses showed a higher AAR in labor wastage rates than men. The density of health workers per 1000 inhabitants employed in the health sector was 4.20, and the estimated deficit of workers needed to match the threshold proposed in the Global Strategy is 70 161 workers distributed among the 16 states that do not reach the threshold. Conclusions: We provide evidence of the existence of gender gaps among physicians and nurses in the labor market with evident disadvantages for female physicians, particularly in labor wastage. In addition, our results suggest that the lack of physicians and nurses working in the health sector contributes to the inability to reach the health worker density threshold proposed by the Global Strategy.","Employment; Gender Inequality; Labor Wastage; Nurses; Physicians; Adult; Article; Doctor Nurse Relation; Female; Female Physician; Gender; Health Care Personnel; Health Insurance; Health Workforce; Human; Job Market; Longitudinal Study; Male; Male Nurse; Mexico; Unemployment; Demography; Nurse; Physician; Sex Ratio; Socioeconomics; Female; Health Workforce; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Nurses; Physicians; Residence Characteristics; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; Universal Health Insurance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085713822"

SDG-3 has a specific target on universal health coverage (UHC), which emphasizes the importance of all people and communities having access to quality health services without risking financial hardship. The objective of this study is to review progress towards UHC using antiretroviral treatment (ART) as a case study. Methods: We used a mixed-methods design including qualitative and quantitative approaches. We reviewed and synthesised the evidence on the evolution of the WHO HIV treatment guidelines between 2002 and 2019. We calculated ART coverage over time by gender, age group, and location. We also estimated ART coverage differences and ratios. Findings: ART guidelines have evolved from ""treating the sickest"" to ""treating all"". ART coverage increased globally from under 7% in 2005 to 62% in 2018. There have been successes in increasing ART coverage in all populations and locations. However, progress varies by population and location in many regions. There is inequity in ART coverage: Women (68%) versus men (55%), and adults (62%) versus children (54%). This inequity has widened over time, and with expanded ART eligibility criteria. On the other hand, data from at least one high-burden country (Ethiopia) shows that inequity among regions has narrowed over time due to the improvements in the primary health care systems and implementation of the public health approach in the country. Conclusion: ART coverage has increased at global, regional and national levels to all population groups. However, the gains have not been equitable among locations and populations. Policies towards universality may widen the inequity in resource-limited settings unless countries take precautions and ""put the last first"". We argue that primary health care and public health approaches, with multi-sectoral actions and community engagement, are vital to minimize inequity, achieve UHC and leave no one behind.","Equity; Hiv, Antiretroviral Treatment; Leaving No One Behind; Universal Health Coverage; Universality; Anti-retroviral Agents; Disease Treatment; Equity; Health Care; Health Risk; Health Services; Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Sustainable Development Goal; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy; Article; Child; Controlled Study; Ethiopia; Female; Gender; Health Insurance; Human; Human Experiment; Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Male; Nonhuman; Population Group; Practice Guideline; Primary Health Care; Public Health; Quantitative Analysis; Health Care Policy; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Qualitative Research; Sex Factor; Sustainable Development; Antiretrovirus Agent; Anti-retroviral Agents; Health Policy; Hiv Infections; Humans; Qualitative Research; Sex Factors; Sustainable Development; Universal Health Insurance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080925230"

However, in practical research, we meet problems with statistical independence of chosen essential properties of objects under comparison. The other problem is the choice of adequate weights for criteria. Weights are usually chosen subjectively (as in the AHP method), as equal (if there are no reasons justifying diversification) or as statistically justified, taking into account discriminant capability and information capacity of the criteria. Our proposition is to choose weights according to the values of variance inflation factors (VIFs)—diagonals of the inverse to the matrix of correlation coefficients across criteria. Greater VIF means smaller information capacity of the criterion and smaller weight is imposed in consequence. The other proposition is choosing weights basing on principal component analysis (PCA) of the covariance matrix—reduction of criteria space dimension. We compare these proposals for classical simple average weighting method (SAW). Another proposition is the method multi-criteria principal components (MCPC) in which weights are assigned to principal components. Our rankings base on EUROSTAT indices for 28 EU countries measuring their achievements of targets of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goal 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” for the year 2017 (or closest).","Criteria Weighting; Interdependent Criteria; Multi-criteria Rankings; Pca; Sustainable Development Goal 3; Vif; Classification (of Information); Covariance Matrix; Data Handling; Multivariant Analysis; Inflation Factors; Matrix Of Correlation; Multi-criteria Ranking; Multivariate Statistical Analysis; Principal Components; Space Dimensions; Statistical Independence; Weighting Methods; Inverse Problems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091083497"

Improving maternal health was one of the eight goals; Millennium Development Goals four (MDG 4) and five (MDG 5) are related to maternal and child health. The fourth goal (MDG 4) aimed at reducing child mortality by two thirds between 1990 and 2015, while the fifth goal (MDG 5) aimed to improve maternal health by reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by three quarters between the same years (WHO, Trends in maternal mortality (1990-2008). WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and World Bank, Geneva, 2010, p. 3). However, they did not meet these promises because the essential role of information and communication was given an afterthought. The United Nations has now embarked on Sustainable Development Goals in which goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, while goal 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. To this end, the objectives of the chapter were investigation of the maternal-child health patients’ knowledge, influence of provider-patient communication, and maternal health communication strategies. The study used the setting of Busia County in Kenya and a review of available literature. Data was analyzed thematically. Findings indicate that lack of maternal-child health knowledge leads to non-utilization of skilled facility health. From the study, we conclude that appropriate communication strategies if mainstreamed in maternal health campaigns can enhance utilization of skilled facility health care, thus accelerating the achievement of MDGs 4 and 5. The study recommends that communication strategies in Africa should foster participation and strengthening of community structures to enhance attaining MDGs 4 and 5. The study was grounded in the social cognitive theory postulated by Albert Bandura. This theory posits that although environmental stimuli influence behavior, individual personal factors such as beliefs and expectations also influence behavior change.","Communication Strategies; Maternal Health Campaigns; Millennium Development Goals; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089644754"

Bioethics and HP both value the interactions between and focus on individuals and, in this approach, the drawing of connections between these topics and the 2030 Agenda presents itself represents a way to stimulate and develop useful measures involving health, well-being, quality of life, and happiness. The results suggest that concepts such as respect for personal dignity, care, protection, sustainable actions, prosperity, peace, partnership, and solidarity were reported by professors surveyed on these topics, with impact on seeking health-related measures able to promote individual and collective well-being, quality of life, inclusion and social justice, principle which are related to bioethics and HP, and the foundations of which are clearly correlated with the 2030 Agenda.","Bioethics; Health Promotion; Higher Education; Sustainable Development; Un 2030 Agenda","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073219294"

The solution is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) executed on a resource constrained low cost embedded micro controller integrated into a sensing unit very close to the microphone. The prototype operates without the need of being connected to a remote server through an always-on connectivity. The adoption of an on-the-edge artificial intelligence architecture brings a set of advantages: safety, reliability, promptness and low power consumption. The embedded intelligence is trained from a purpose-built dataset enclosing environmental car engine sound data. A pre trained ANN classifies sound events and counts cars approaching and leaving the microphone by sensing the Doppler Effects in the sound emitted by the moving vehicles.

However, suboptimal availability, accessibility, quality and utilisation of EmONC services hampered meeting Millennium Development Goal target 5A. Evaluation and modelling tools of health system performance and future potential can help countries to optimise their strategies towards reaching Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. The standard set of indicators for monitoring EmONC has been found useful for assessing quality and utilisation but does not account for travel time required to physically access health services. The increased use of geographical information systems, availability of free geographical modelling tools such as AccessMod and the quality of geographical data provide opportunities to complement the existing EmONC indicators by adding geographically explicit measurements. This paper proposes three additional EmONC indicators to the standard set for monitoring EmONC; two consider physical accessibility and a third addresses referral time from basic to comprehensive EmONC services. We provide examples to illustrate how the AccessMod tool can be used to measure these indicators, analyse service utilisation and propose options for the scaling-up of EmONC services. The additional indicators and analysis methods can supplement traditional EmONC assessments by informing approaches to improve timely access to achieve Universal Health Coverage and reach SDG 3.","Emergency Obstetric And Newborn Care; Physical Accessibility; Sustainable Development Goals; Universal Health Coverage; Article; Case Report; Clinical Article; Emergency; Female; Geographic Information System; Health Insurance; Human; Lowest Income Group; Male; Middle Income Country; Monitoring; Newborn Care; Patient Referral; Scale Up; Sustainable Development; Travel","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068938057"

Objectives: To quantify subnational regional inequality in access to improved drinking water and sanitation in Indonesia. Methods: Data about access to improved drinking water and sanitation were derived from the 2015 Indonesian National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) and disaggregated by 510 districts across the 34 provinces of Indonesia. Two summary measures of inequality, mean difference from mean and weighted index of disparity, were calculated to quantify within-province absolute and relative inequality, respectively. Results: While the majority of Indonesian households had access to improved drinking water (71.0%) and sanitation (62.1%), there were large variations between and within provinces. Access to improved drinking water ranged from 93.4% in DKI Jakarta to 41.1% in Bengkulu, and access to improved sanitation ranged from 89.3% in Jakarta to 23.9% in East Nusa Tenggara. Provinces with similar numbers of districts and similar overall averages showed variable levels of absolute and/or relative inequality. Certain districts reported very low levels of access to improved drinking water and/or sanitation. Conclusions: There are inequalities in access to improved drinking water and sanitation by subnational region in Indonesia. Monitoring within-country inequality in these indicators serves to identify underserved areas, and is useful for developing approaches to improve inequalities in access that can help Indonesia make progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.","Health Equity; Health Inequality; Indonesia; Monitoring Health Inequality In Indonesia; Sanitation; Water; Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Geography; Health Equity; Human; Indonesia; Questionnaire; Sanitation; Socioeconomics; Statistics And Numerical Data; Water Supply; Drinking Water; Geography; Health Equity; Humans; Sanitation; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys And Questionnaires; Water Supply","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050923688"

While concerns have been raised, how water carriage is associated with health of the water carrier is not clear. The aim of this review is to summarise evidence on whether, and how, water carriage is associated with the water carrier's health. Methods A systematic review of literature was conducted, searching Embase; Medline; Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index; Web of Science Arts and Humanities Citation Index; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation website; WHO Virtual Health Sciences Library and WHO African index medicus, from inception to 8 November 2017. Results Forty-two studies were included. Their ability to demonstrate cause and effect relationships was limited by study design and fair or poor methodological quality. Overall, the studies suggest that water carriage is associated with negative aspects of the water carriers' health. There is moderate quantitative and strong qualitative evidence that water carriage is associated with pain, fatigue, perinatal health problems and violence against vulnerable people, and inconclusive evidence of an association with stress or self-reported mental health and general health status. Conclusion In many circumstances, water carriage is a potential barrier to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 target 'universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all' and SDG 3 'ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages'. Efforts should focus on providing water on premises, and where this is not possible, providing water close to home and reducing risk of gender-based violence.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061801755"

Their cause can be broadly categorized as genetic, environmental, or a combination of both. It is estimated that approximately 3–6% of newborn infants worldwide are affected by BD, many of which are associated with serious morbidity, mortality, and lifelong disabilities. The International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR), founded in 1974, promotes worldwide birth defect surveillance, research, and prevention through the ongoing sharing of data, expertise, and training. In this review, we show value and contribution of BD surveillance systems in pursuing these aims. In the time of personalized medicine for many rare and common diseases, there are still massive gaps in our understanding of the causes and mechanisms of many birth defects, especially structural congenital anomalies. The main aim of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all children. One specific goal is to end preventable deaths of newborns and children less than 5 years of age by 2030. The SDGs also underscore the need to consider BD as a priority in the global child health agenda. It can be said that counting BD helps BD to count. By sharing data and expertise and joining in surveillance and research, BD surveillance programs can play a major role in increasing our understanding of the causes of BD, and promoting prevention.","Birth Defects; Congenital Anomalies; Icbdsr; Registries; Research; Surveillance; Article; Child; Child Health; Childhood Mortality; Clinical Research; Congenital Malformation; Data Processing; Disease Surveillance; Health Program; Health Promotion; Human; Newborn; Newborn Mortality; Pathogenesis; Personalized Medicine; Priority Journal; Rare Disease; United Nations; Wellbeing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053658083"

Despite their extensive use in the e-commerce and leisure domains, their application in healthcare is still in its infancy. These systems may be used to create tailored health interventions, thus reducing the cost of healthcare and fostering a healthier lifestyle in the population. Objective: This paper identifies, categorizes, and analyzes the existing knowledge in terms of the literature published over the past 10 years on the use of health recommender systems for patient interventions. The aim of this study is to understand the scientific evidence generated about health recommender systems, to identify any gaps in this field to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) (namely, “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”), and to suggest possible reasons for these gaps as well as to propose some solutions. Methods: We conducted a scoping review, which consisted of a keyword search of the literature related to health recommender systems for patients in the following databases: ScienceDirect, PsycInfo, Association for Computing Machinery, IEEExplore, and Pubmed. Further, we limited our search to consider only English-language journal articles published in the last 10 years. The reviewing process comprised three researchers who filtered the results simultaneously. The quantitative synthesis was conducted in parallel by two researchers, who classified each paper in terms of four aspects—the domain, the methodological and procedural aspects, the health promotion theoretical factors and behavior change theories, and the technical aspects—using a new multidisciplinary taxonomy. Results: Nineteen papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the data analysis, for which thirty-three features were assessed. The nine features associated with the health promotion theoretical factors and behavior change theories were not observed in any of the selected studies, did not use principles of tailoring, and did not assess (cost)-effectiveness. Discussion: Health recommender systems may be further improved by using relevant behavior change strategies and by implementing essential characteristics of tailored interventions. In addition, many of the features required to assess each of the domain aspects, the methodological and procedural aspects, and technical aspects were not reported in the studies. Conclusions: The studies analyzed presented few evidence in support of the positive effects of using health recommender systems in terms of cost-effectiveness and patient health outcomes. This is why future studies should ensure that all the proposed features are covered in our multidisciplinary taxonomy, including integration with electronic health records and the incorporation of health promotion theoretical factors and behavior change theories. This will render those studies more useful for policymakers since they will cover all aspects needed to determine their impact toward meeting SDG3.","Behavior Change; Health Intervention; Health Promotion; Patient; Recommendation; Recommender System; Tailoring; Taxonomy; Computation Theory; Cost Effectiveness; Costs; Electronic Commerce; Information Retrieval Systems; Machinery; Patient Treatment; Search Engines; Taxonomies; Behavior Change; Health Interventions; Health Promotion; Patient; Recommendation; Tailoring; Recommender Systems; Clinical Decision Support System; Cost Benefit Analysis; Health Care Delivery; Health Promotion; Human; Medical Information; Medical Record; Standards; Theoretical Model; Cost-benefit Analysis; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Delivery Of Health Care; Health Communication; Health Promotion; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Models, Theoretical","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040373452"

Moreover, a well-funded and well-supported health workforce is vital to achieving universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goal 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. This perspective article highlights the potential of underutilized health policy and systems research (HPSR) approaches for developing more effective human resources for health policy. The example of health worker motivation is used to showcase four types of HPSR (exploratory, influence, explanatory and emancipatory) that move beyond describing the extent of a problem. Most of the current literature aiming to understand determinants and dynamics of motivation is descriptive in nature. While this is an important basis for all research pursuits, it often gives little information about mechanisms to improve motivation and strategies for intervention. Motivation is an essential determinant of health worker performance, particularly for those working in difficult conditions, such as those facing many health workers in low- and middle-income countries. Motivation mediates health workforce performance in multiple ways: internally governing health worker behaviour; informing decisions on becoming a health worker; workplace location and ability to perform; and influencing willingness to engage politically. The four fresh research approaches described can help policy-makers better understand why health workers behave the way they do, how interventions can improve performance, the mechanisms that lead to change, and strategies for empowering health workers to be agents of change themselves.","Health Policy And Systems Research; Human Resources For Health; Migration; Motivation; Performance; Supervision; Global Health; Health Care Personnel; Health Care Planning; Health Care Policy; Health Services Research; Human; Motivation; Procedures; Psychology; Global Health; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Health Resources; Health Services Research; Humans; Motivation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047780298"

This is likely to have a deep impact in the Health Systems in the next few years. The new Cochrane Rehabilitation Field has been invited by WHO as a relevant stakeholder in this effort. WHO recognizes the dramatic changes in health and demographic profiles of populations that are characterizing the 21st century. Main goals of WHO are to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, and to promote healthy life expectancy. Methods. Health systems and health policies are placing increased emphasis on services targeted at improving functioning, and not only at decreasing morbidity and mortality. According to WHO, rehabilitation could be an answer to this need. Cochrane's strategy becomes significant in this context, as it is based on the production of high-quality evidence through systematic reviews to inform health decision making. Results. Cochrane Rehabilitation is the appropriate instrument in this endeavour: its main goal is to convey to all rehabilitation professionals the best available evidence, but also to improve the Cochrane methods for evidence synthesis. This will help rehabilitation professionals to make decisions according to the best and most appropriate evidence. Conclusion. An important challenge of Cochrane Rehabilitation in the next future is to respond to the WHO ""Rehabilitation 2030"" call for action.","Article; Decision Making; Health Care Policy; Human; Life Expectancy; Morbidity; Mortality; Rehabilitation; Synthesis; Systematic Review; Wellbeing; World Health Organization; Health Care Delivery; Health Care Personnel; Organization And Management; Rehabilitation Medicine; Trends; World Health Organization; Decision Making; Delivery Of Health Care; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Humans; Physical And Rehabilitation Medicine; Rehabilitation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042733569"

Our optimism around 5G-enabled healthcare stems from a confluence of significant technical pushes that are already at play: apart from the availability of high-throughput low-latency wireless connectivity, other significant factors include the democratization of computing through cloud computing; the democratization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing (e.g., IBMWatson); and the commoditization of data through crowdsourcing and digital exhaust. These technologies together can finally crack a dysfunctional healthcare system that has largely been impervious to technological innovations. We highlight the persistent deficiencies of the current healthcare system and then demonstrate how the 5G-enabled healthcare revolution can fix these deficiencies. We also highlight open technical research challenges, and potential pitfalls, that may hinder the development of such a 5G-enabled health revolution.","5g; Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning; Big Data Analytics; Healthcare; Internet Of Things; 5g Mobile Communication Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Engineering Education; Internet Of Things; Learning Systems; Wireless Telecommunication Systems; Cognitive Computing; Data Analytics; Emerging Technologies; Health-care System; Low-latency Wireless Connectivity; Technical Research; Technological Innovation; Wireless Technologies; Health Care","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037742584"

A range of assistive technologies have been proposed to support dementia care. However, the World Health Organization estimated in 2017 that only one in 10 of the 1 billion or more people globally who could benefit from these technologies in some way actually has access to them. For people living with dementia, there has been little analysis of whether assistive technologies will support their human rights in ways that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The aim of this paper is to examine the relevant provisions of the convention and consider their implications for the use of assistive technologies in dementia care. Assistive technologies can clearly play an important role in supporting social engagement, decision-making and advance planning by people living with dementia. However, concerns exist that some of these technologies also have the potential to restrict freedom of movement and intrude into privacy. In conclusion, an analysis of the implications of assistive technologies for human rights laws is needed to ensure that technologies are used in ways that support human rights and help meet the health-related SDG 3.","Disability; Environmental Hazard; Ethics; Health Care; Human Rights; Public Health; Service Provision; Sustainable Development; Technology; United Nations; World Health Organization; Article; Assistive Technology; Cognitive Defect; Decision Making; Dementia; Health Care Planning; Health Care Policy; Human; Medical Information; Medicolegal Aspect; Mental Health Care; Privacy; Psychological Well-being; World Health Organization; Disabled Person; Psychology; Self Help Device; Dementia; Disabled Persons; Human Rights; Humans; Self-help Devices","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032987828"

The findings from multivariate logistic regressions show that women in Nigeria were 23% less likely to utilise skilled delivery services in 2013 compared to 2003. In Malawi, women were 75% more likely to utilise skilled delivery services in 2010 than in 2000. Residential wealth index was a significant predictor of utilisation of skilled delivery services over time in both Nigeria and Malawi.

With the inception of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a new threshold of 4.45 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 population has been identified. This SDG index threshold indicates the minimum density to respond to the needs of health workers to deliver a much broader range of health services, such as management of non-communicable diseases to meet the targets under Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all people of all ages. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the density of skilled health workers in 2012 was 0.5 per 1,000 population, which more than doubled from 0.2 per 1,000 in 2002. However, this showed that Tanzania still faced a critical shortage of skilled health workers. While training, deployment, and retention are important, motivation is also necessary for all health workers, particularly those who serve in rural areas. This study measured the motivation of health workers who were posted at government-run rural primary health facilities. Objectives We sought to measure three aspects of motivation-Management, Performance, and Individual Aspects-among health workers deployed in rural primary level government health facilities. In addition, we also sought to identify the job-related attributes associated with each of these three aspects. Two regions in Tanzania were selected for our research. In each region, we further selected two districts in which we carried out our investigation. The two regions were Lindi, where we carried out our study in the Nachingwea District and the Ruangwa District, and Mbeya, within which the Mbarali and Rungwe Districts were selected for research. All four districts are considered rural. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted by administering a two-part questionnaire in the Kiswahili language. The first part was administered by a researcher, and contained questions for gaining socio-demographic and occupational information. The second part was a self-administered questionnaire that contained 45 statements used to measure three aspects of motivation among health workers. For analyzing the data, we performed multivariate regression analysis in order to evaluate the simultaneous effects of factors on the outcomes of the motivation scores in the three areas of Management, Performance, and Individual Aspects. Results Motivation was associated with marital status (p = 0.009), having a job description (p<0.001), and number of years in the current profession (<1 year: P = 0.043, <7 years: P = 0.042) for Management Aspects; having a job description (p<0.001) for Performance Aspects; and salary scale (p = 0.029) for Individual Aspects. Conclusion Having a clear job description motivates health workers. The existing Open Performance Review and Appraisal System, of which job descriptions are the foundation, needs to be institutionalized in order to effectively manage the health workforce in resource-limited settings.","Adult; Article; Cross-sectional Study; Demography; Female; Geographic Distribution; Health Care Facility; Health Care Personnel; Health Care Survey; Health Care Utilization; Human; Job Satisfaction; Male; Marriage; Medical Education; Motivation; Personnel Management; Primary Health Care; Rural Area; Social Status; Tanzania; Middle Aged; Organization And Management; Psychology; Rural Health Care; Young Adult; Adult; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Primary Health Care; Rural Health Services; Young Adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019020975"

Depression in patients with diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, stroke or cardiovascular disease is 2-4-fold more prevalent than in people who do not have physical noncommunicable diseases, and may have a more prolonged course. The significant burden due to depression that is comorbid with chronic physical disease, coupled with limited resources, makes it a major public health challenge for low- and middle-income countries. Given the bidirectional relation between depression and chronic physical disease, the clear way forward in managing this population of patients is via a system in which mental health care is integrated with primary care. Central to this integrated approach is the Collaborative Care Model, adapted to the local sociocultural context. In this model, care is jointly led by the primary care physician, supported by a case manager and a mental health professional. Various successful initiatives in low- and middle-income countries may be used as templates for collaborative care in other low-resource settings. The model involves a range of interwoven components, such as capacity-building, task-sharing, task-shifting, developing good referral and linkage systems, anti-stigma initiatives and lifestyle modifications. Policies based on adoption of this approach would not only directly address depression that is comorbid with physical noncommunicable disease but also facilitate achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3, to ""ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"".","Comorbidity; Depression; Developing Country; Health Care Policy; Health Service; Human; Integrated Health Care System; Mental Health Service; Non Communicable Disease; Nonbiological Model; Organization And Management; Primary Health Care; Comorbidity; Delivery Of Health Care, Integrated; Depression; Developing Countries; Health Policy; Health Services Needs And Demand; Humans; Mental Health Services; Models, Organizational; Noncommunicable Diseases; Primary Health Care","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045945059"

As people live more, it is necessary to ensure a satisfying and healthy life for them. Moreover, as the number of older people is higher, there is a higher amount of people out of the working life and there is a need of choices to spend the leisure time and there is a need of social inclusion, against the risk of isolation. Retirement, as a transition time, can be differently considered by people. Objective: The aim of the study was to measure the emotional condition in a group of elderly students, basing on the hypothesis of which these persons improve in this aspect thanks to the effect that produces in them the experience of the University for people aged over 55 years in the University of the Basque Country. Method: 63 people, over 55 years old students attending the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, were evaluated their psychological symptomatology by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Socio-demographic data were also collected. Results: Our results suggest that University for over 55 years may improve mental health or people attending them. These data should be considered as a summation of multiple factors. Conclusion: So, as life expectancy is increasing, population ageing is a major global trend and there is a need for transforming economies and societies around the world, we think it is important to continue creating resources for old people since most of them at retirement age still have very good physical and psychological health, in order to help to prevent isolation, mental health problems and promote wellbeing in later life.

The health goal (SDG 3) has nine substantive targets and four additional targets which are identified as a means of implementation. One of these commitments, to achieve universal health coverage (UHC), has been acknowledged as central to the achievement of all of the other health targets. As defined in the SDGs, UHC includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services, and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Discussion: This article evaluates the extent to which the UHC target in the SDGs conforms with the requirements of the right to health enumerated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and other international human rights instruments and interpreted by international human rights bodies. It does so as a means to identify strengths and weaknesses in the framing of the UHC target that are likely to affect its implementation. Summary: While UHC as defined in the SDGs overlaps with human rights standards, there are important human rights omissions that will likely weaken the implementation and reduce the potential benefits of the UHC target. The most important of these is the failure to confer priority to providing access to health services to poor and disadvantaged communities in the process of expanding health coverage and in determining which health services to provide. Unless the furthest behind are given priority and strategies adopted to secure their participation in the development of national health plans, the SDGs, like the MDGs, are likely to leave the most disadvantaged and vulnerable communities behind.","Access To Health Services; Financial Risk Protection; Priority To The Disadvantaged; Rights-based; Universal Health Coverage; Vaccine; Article; Drug Cost; Financial Management; Health Care Access; Health Care Planning; Health Care Quality; Health Insurance; Health Program; Health Service; Human; Human Rights; Human Rights Abuse; Safety; Social Status; Sustainable Development; Economics; Environmental Protection; Evaluation Study; Global Health; Health Care Delivery; Insurance; International Cooperation; Motivation; Poverty; United Nations; Vulnerable Population; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Global Health; Goals; Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; Human Rights; Humans; International Cooperation; Poverty; Universal Coverage; Vulnerable Populations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006354697"

For the goals to be achieved, everyone needs to do their part: governments, academia, the private sector and all people. This paper summarizes the main evidence-based recommendations made by excellent academics and scholars who discussed their experiences and views during the conference to respond to the challenges of sustainable health development. Methods: To contribute to exploring to the academia's role in reaching SDGs, the 1st International Conference on Sustainable Health Development was held at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, on 24-25 April 2016, in Tehran, Iran. Results: In line with Goal 3 of SDGs: ""ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"", the conference discussed various aspects of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), as well as Global Action Plans for prevention and control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), and explained the special role of academic public health institutes in education, research and service provision in the two above-mentioned areas. Conclusion: To fulfill the requirements of SDGs, modern approaches to funding, education, teaching, research priority setting and advocacy, which in turn need novel strategies in collaboration and constructive partnerships among academic public health institutes from low, middle and high-income countries, are essential.","Academia; Ncd; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Uhc","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84998693413"

Yet, health transition and disparities in provision and financing threaten this situation. Sri Lanka did well on the Millennium Development Goal health indicators, but the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for health has a wider purview, which is to ""ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"". The gender gap in life expectancy and the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy make achievement of the health SDG more challenging. Although women and children do well overall, the comparative health disadvantage for men in Sri Lanka is a cause for concern. From a financing perspective, high out-of-pocket expenditure and high utilization of the private sector, even by those in the lowest income quintile, are concerns, as is the emerging ""third tier"", where some individuals accessing state health care that is free at the point of delivery actually bear some of the costs of drugs, investigations and surgery. This cost sharing is resulting in catastrophic health expenditure for individuals, and delays in and non-compliance with treatment. These concerns about provision and financing must be addressed, as health transition will intensify the morbidity burden and loss of well-being, and could derail plans to achieve the health SDG.","Economics; Financial Management; Health Care Cost; Health Care Delivery; Health Care Disparity; Health Disparity; Human; Insurance; Life Expectancy; Motivation; Organization And Management; Sex Factor; Sri Lanka; Delivery Of Health Care; Financing, Personal; Goals; Health Expenditures; Health Status Disparities; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Life Expectancy; Sex Factors; Universal Coverage","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027553218"

The population is ageing globally leading to an increasingly ageing workforce and with the abolishment of an official retirement age working into later life is becoming commonplace. Natural age-related declines such as reduced vision, hearing and muscle strength make it difficult to remain in industries such as construction where heavy manual labour is commonplace. A previous study by the authors found that construction workers have good ideas for both maintaining and improving their health and well-being at work. Workers suggested solutions which could facilitate healthy ageing such as improving facilities and personal protective equipment and wanting better knowledge transfer systems such as more apprentices to pass their knowledge on to. This paper discusses how these findings could be used in the construction industry to improve health, well-being and healthy ageing. Focus groups with industry stakeholders presented them with these ideas; they were asked about their perceptions of older workers and how they thought the ideas suggested by their workforce could be used to improve health, well-being and ageing. Barriers and opportunities to change were investigated and stakeholders were encouraged to consider how they could encourage involvement of their workers using participatory ergonomics techniques. Stakeholders were positive about the older workforce and were keen to promote change within their companies. This research forms part of a larger study, sponsored by Age UK's Research into Ageing Fund, which aims to produce a resource for dissemination across the industry, encouraging engagement of the workforce to facilitate healthy working behaviours. It is essential that ideas from workers are harnessed and utilised to ensure that all workers can age healthily at work.","Ageing; Construction; Participatory Ergonomics; Workplace Ergonomics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009956939"

All governments must develop mechanisms to cater for population ageing issues and at the same time grapple with the issues of development. Since the first World Assembly on Ageing in Vienna, several international plans of actions have been adopted by governments to prepare for the impending aged nations. The varied status of the implementation of programmes and policies analysed during the Second World Assembly resulted in the resolution of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA) in 2002. MIPAA sets a new agenda for handling the issue of ageing in the twenty-first century focusing on three Priority Directions: Older Persons and Development; Advancing Health and Well-being into Old Age and Ensuring Enabling and Supportive Environments (United Nations, 2002a). MIPAA strongly emphasized that every society has a duty to equally explore the possibilities of benefiting from the varied resources of older persons to the fullest extent possible as outlined in its Priority Direction 1. Article 16 of MIPAA clearly states that “older persons must be full participants in the development process and also share in its benefits”; and Article 19 states: “A society for all ages encompasses the goal of providing older persons with the opportunity to continue contributing to society.” This chapter addresses specifically Priority Direction 1 on Older Persons and Development of the Madrid Plan. Older persons are often at risk of being excluded directly or indirectly from communities and social life through social institutions developed as mechanisms for social withdrawal. Hence, the older persons must be mainstreamed in order to fully re-integrate them into society and be recognized as experienced human resource. The economic and social positions of older persons and the manner in which they negotiate their place in society has recently become the focus of much attention in the analysis of exclusion and social policy in developing countries. With the rapid pace of development, older persons are often marginalized and the loss of their traditional roles and functions has significantly eroded their importance in the community. There is a general agreement about the lack of “fit” between the older persons and the roles and functions they fulfil (Uhlenberg, 1992). The problems will exacerbate since those reaching old age are now increasingly well educated, healthy and economically secure, and it is expected that this new cohort would make productive contributions to the society. The impact of population ageing and changes taking place in the world creates the need for urgent action to ensure the continuing participation, integration and empowerment of the older persons. Older persons have the potential and can contribute to the national development. In response to this, older persons must be able to represent themselves as such to the community and society at large. They need to gain importance not only in terms of economic standing but also social standing by reaffirming their roles and functions in their community. To have a role and function in communities requires older persons to be active. There are various policy frameworks with their attendant policies available globally to guide the development of relevant programmes, facilities and services around them (WHO, 2002; Sharifah, 2007; Wong, 2007). The concept of active ageing can contribute to the active participation and empowerment of the older persons. According to Walker (2002), there are several principles embodied in the concept of active ageing. One of the principles is that activity should contribute to the well-being of the individual concerned, the family and the community or society at large, and should not be concerned only with paid employment or production. Of importance, active ageing should be participative and empowering. It is this concept of active ageing that this chapter focuses on representing a new direction in older persons and development. Active ageing depends on a variety of factors that exist in the many domains of human activity. The focus of Priority Direction 1 is the two over-arching social and economic domains. Against this background, the chapter provides a situation analysis of the ageing situation in Malaysia and the government’s effort to promote active ageing. The chapter highlights the changes and challenges in the social and economic domains that have significant effects on active ageing as suggested by WHO.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84967223714"

In particular there is a need to move from health and social agendas that emphasise dependency in later life to ones that promote active aging at home. AAL-WELL is a collaboration between Simon Fraser University and University of Toronto (Cananda), University of Sheffield (UK) and Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) funded under the ERA-AGE program to harness the potential of ambient assistive living (AAL) technology to promote active and healthy aging with a specific focus on older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Background: Our research questions are: (i) What needs do older adults with MCI prioritise that AAL-based systems could meet and are there cultural/national differences in these needs? (ii) How can AAL-based systems and services be used to enhance the well-being of older adults with MCI and enable them to live more independently? (iii) What are the barriers and facilitators to the uptake of AAL by older adults with MCI, and how can AAL be effectively exploited? In addition, AAL-WELL will: (iv) Develop an international and multidisciplinary network of collaborators to share best practice and expertise, promote the building and transfer of knowledge by working together with various stakeholder groups; (v) Plan the commercialization of AAL products and services resulting from this project; (vi) Build research capacity and expertise by developing a critical mass of skills and expertise to achieve excellence in research; and (vii) Work beyond disciplinary and national boundaries. Method: Through the completion of four work packages, this project will develop and test various AAL technologies to support older adults with MCI. The project (WP1) will first learn about the needs and preferences of older adults with MCI to determine the types of technologies that should be built and the features these should include. A primary outcome of this WP will be example user scenarios. Next, these scenarios will be used to develop specific models that will allow for a systematic approach to be applied in the development of examples of innovative and novel AAL technologies through an iterative and userdriven process (WP2). Finally, these applications will be tested through user trials (WP3) that will focus on determining the usability and appropriateness of each system. Results & Discussion: While people with MCI experience declines in cognitive abilities, these are not the same level and effect as dementia. Help and support through technology should be focused on ensuring full social participation, rather than on more fundamental activities of daily living and safety and security. For instance, easy to use interfaces using relational agents will help people with MCI use and engage with everyday technologies and information systems. The resulting technologies have the potential to support older adults to remain in their own communities and homes and will help to increase life lived without disability.","Aal; Communication & Governance; Mild Cognitive Impairment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929395522"

The magnitude of the problem has increased dramatically during the last three decades and, despite some indications of a plateau in this growth, the numbers remain stubbornly high. Efforts to prevent childhood obesity to date have focused largely on school-aged children, with relatively little attention to children under age 5. However, there is a growing awareness that efforts to prevent childhood obesity must begin before children ever enter the school system. Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Policies reviews factors related to overweight and obese children from birth to age 5, with a focus on nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, and recommends policies that can alter children's environments to promote the maintenance of healthy weight. Because the first years of life are important to health and well-being throughout the life span, preventing obesity in infants and young children can contribute to reversing the epidemic of obesity in children and adults. The book recommends that health care providers make parents aware of their child's excess weight early. It also suggests that parents and child care providers keep children active throughout the day, provide them with healthy diets, limit screen time, and ensure children get adequate sleep. In addition to providing comprehensive solutions to tackle the problem of obesity in infants and young children, Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Policies identifies potential actions that could be taken to implement those recommendations. The recommendations can inform the decisions of state and local child care regulators, child care providers, health care providers, directors of federal and local child care and nutrition programs, and government officials at all levels.","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014300630"

Methods: Incidence and follow-up data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (1975-2001) were used to calculate the number of survivors with more than one malignant primary at January 1, 2002. U.S. prevalence counts were calculated by multiplying the age, sex, and race-specific prevalence proportions from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program by the corresponding U.S. populations. Results: We estimate that 756,467 people in the United States have been affected by cancer more than once between 1975 and 2001, representing almost 8% of the current cancer survivor population. Women whose first primary in that period was breast cancer represent 25% of survivors with multiple cancers, followed by men and women (15%) whose first primary was colorectal cancer and men (13%) whose first primary was prostate cancer. Discussion: The findings in this report have important implications for public health practice. With individuals diagnosed with cancer living longer and the aging of the U.S. population, the number who will develop multiple malignancies is expected to increase. As a consequence, there is a growing need to promote effective cancer screening along with healthy life-styles among these at-risk populations if we are to ensure optimal physical and psychosocial well-being of these long-term cancer survivors and their families. Efforts to design and evaluate effective, efficient, and equitable approaches to surveillance for second malignancies will be critical in reducing the national burden of cancer.
