This goal aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss. The conservation status of the observed species ranged from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered, with Shorea astylosa classified as Critically Endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Species composition varied across altitudinal gradients, with Dipterocarpus kerrii and Shorea almon prevalent at lower altitudes, while Shorea contorta was more common at higher elevations. The Importance Value Index (IVI) indicated that Shorea polysperma and Shorea contorta are dominant species, crucial for ecological processes. The diameter at breast height (DBH) distribution showed a healthy mix of young and mature trees, indicating active regeneration and the presence of established trees. These findings emphasize the need for targeted conservation efforts, including habitat protection and land-use regulation, to preserve the biodiversity and ecological integrity of Mt. Panamao.","Altitudinal Gradients; Biodiversity Conservation; Philippine Dipterocarps; Sustainable Development Goals","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009976122"

The central focus of Sustainable Development Goal 15 is life on land. It aims to “protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.” Africa, a continent rich in biodiversity, has been plagued by environmental issues and despite international treaties and the convening of world leaders, threats to biodiversity in Africa remain particularly troublesome. This chapter critically analyses the root causes of biodiversity loss, which include armed conflict, crime against wildlife, and deforestation. The chapter further argues that international law, for the most part, has been ineffective in addressing biodiversity loss in Africa and adopting an ecocentric approach, instead of an anthropocentric approach is vital to combat the causes of biodiversity loss in Africa. Ecocentrism finds intrinsic value in all of nature, which differs from anthropocentrism, which places value on human life above all else. Through critical analysis, this chapter argues that ecocentrism will naturally benefit the conservation of Africa’s ecology, including its people. It is recommended that international law must reflect an ecocentric approach as opposed to placing value on the environment only insofar as it benefits human beings. The author does not underestimate the importance the environment plays in the sustainable development of people and their right to a healthy environment but argues that to achieve environmental sustainability, the environment should be looked at from a perspective that places equal importance on all living organisms and non-living organisms.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177536786"

In England ancient woodland is identified as those areas of woodland that have existed since the seventeenth century and they remain crucial areas of natural habitat and biodiversity in the English countryside (Woodland Trust https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/habitats/ancient-woodland/, 2021). However, outside of these ecosystem benefits, they also provide an environment for educating young people about sustainability and for delivering social innovations that support local communities socially and environmentally. This chapter explores how education within an ancient woodland setting can help to promote environmental awareness, as well as supporting the creation of social impact. Utilising the case-study of a social enterprise in England that maintains ancient woodland and educates socially excluded young people, the chapter seeks to argue that the hybrid mission of the organisation combined with its unique environmental location, provides the perfect model for supporting socially disadvantaged individuals to become the ‘changemakers’ of tomorrow. The UN Sustainable Development Goal 4.7 states that ‘By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development’.","Ancient Woodland; Changemakers; Environmental Education; Social Impact; Social Innovation","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219026076"

Relying on mixed method approach to research, data collection comprising field observation, ground truthing, plant species inventory, and key-informant interviews and analysis of data, two spots were purposively sampled, one from each of the two LGAs; Mbom in Bende LGA and Amangwu in Ohafia Local Government Area (LGA). A 50 × 20 m quadrat was sampled from each site, from where plant species inventory was undertaken. Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H’) was used to analyse the data. The result of Shannon–Wiener diversity index, shows that the diversity indices of the plant species for the two sites were 3.20 (Mbom) and 3.95 (Amangwu) respectively. The people of Bende and Ohafia LGAs employ some traditional laws to ensure conservation of woody plant species so as to achieve goal 15th of the SDGs.

A German-Mongolian advisory assistance project, agreed between the Mongolian Ministry for Environment and Tourism and the German Federal Ministry for Environment and implemented 2017 till 2019, provided support for the coal-mining sector to specify and to adopt overall rehabilitation standards and recommendations for the implementation of a geo-hydrological monitoring. A ""Guideline on the Rehabilitation of Open-pit Coal-mines"" (GROM) addresses mine rehabilitation, targeting managers at the operational level and environmental officers from the authorities, as well as public regulators. The technical guideline is framed around the operational sequence in mining operations, i.e. legal basis, planning, operations and mine closure. Particular emphasis is given to the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems and replacement and compensatory measures. Landscape design for rehabilitation requires a holistic view on mining operations as a whole. Environmental staff should be able to improve and assure the quality of executed rehabilitation work and to discover and settle deficits, right from the beginning on of mining projects. The EU Mining Waste Directive (2006/21/EC) were proposed as an approved international regulation with regard to easy applicable technical and pragmatic criteria to assess the impact and remedial requirements caused by hazardous substances impacts and geo-technical issues. For the implementation, the guidance document explains international standards and gives practical recommendations on the different fields of the rehabilitation work in open-pit coal mining. As an overall objective the guideline shall support the Sustainable Development Goals (especially SDG 15 ""Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss"").

The justifiability and topicality of this issue result from the increasingly strong interest in sustainability of the society as a whole as well as from the long-term vision of sector policies with respect to meeting the objectives of sustainable development. The increasing demand for natural resources exerts pressure on our planet. Sustainability is hence essential for our future and has long been in the centre of the European project. Its economic, social and environmental aspects which form the common objective of society have been acknowledged in EU agreements. A principal document of a global nature is the 2030 UN Agenda for Development, a sustainability programme which has the sustainability of forest ecosystems established in its Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Visions, direction and goals of sustainable development have also been stipulated in the Paris Agreement on climate change (COP21), in the Addis Ababa action programme and in The Future We Want declaration, namely in its Chapter II, which appeals to enterprises and industries for developing strategies which would contribute to sustainable development. This study aims to analyse and assess the justifiability of the existence of certification systems in relation to processing operators and end consumers in the Czech Republic. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that, despite the strong representation of selected certification systems in the Czech Republic, their effectiveness in economic, social and environmental terms is not perceived exclusively positive by businesses and consumers.","Effectiveness; Forest Sustainability; Fsc; Pefc; Sustainable Management; Business Service; Certification; Climate Change; Consumption Behavior; Ecosystem Management; European Union; International Agreement; Policy Development; Socioeconomic Impact; Sustainable Forestry; Europe","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070448614"

A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6% (74,609 Mg ha−1) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource. In evaluating the status, trends and drivers of land degradation for this region, we have identified key areas or “hot spots” that may be targeted for restoration options and may be used to achieve LDN targets by 2030.","Challenges; Hot Spots; Indicators; Ldn Target; Opportunities; Trends; Organic Carbon; Article; Biodiversity; Cropland; Forest; Land Degradation Neutrality; Land Use; Priority Journal; Republic Of Srpska; Shrub","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054071512"

The Programme is implemented by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. In 2014, as a result of discussions with researchers at the United Nations University - Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability, a new thematic priority on the theme ""monitoring and protecting biodiversity and ecosystems"" was added to the Programme. The new thematic priority was subsequently endorsed by the United Nations Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and the United Nations General Assembly. It is closely linked to and aligned with relevant goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 15 ""Life on Land - to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss"". As a first activity the Office for Outer Space Affairs, in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Government of Kenya and with the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) organized the ""United Nations/Kenya Conference on Space Technologies and Applications for Wildlife Management and Protecting Biodiversity"", held at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, in June 2016. The Conference aimed to bring together stakeholders involved in biodiversity and wildlife management, representatives of space industry, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and expert communities, space applications and geo-spatial experts and the users of such applications, as well as park rangers and wildlife managers, to share their user requirements and experience and to present existing and planned space technologies and applications. The present paper reports on the new thematic priority of the Programme on Space Applications, on the observations and recommendations of the United Nations/Kenya Conference and on future activities to promote the use of space applications for monitoring and protecting biodiversity and ecosystems.","Biodiversity; Capacity Building; Ecosystems; Sustainable Development; Wildlife Management; Animals; Biodiversity; Economic And Social Effects; Ecosystems; Environmental Protection; Environmental Technology; Planning; Space Applications; Space Optics; Sustainable Development; User Experience; Capacity Building; Ministry Of Environments; Nongovernmental Organizations; Social And Environmental; Terrestrial Ecosystems; United Nations Environment Programme; United Nations Universities; Wildlife Management; Aerospace Industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016479439"
