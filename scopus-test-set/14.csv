The ocean SDG was successfully championed by Pacific Island Countries with cooperation from other Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The special needs of SIDS are considered within two SDG 14 targets. Trinidad and Tobago is a SIDS located in the Caribbean region, with collectively 704 km of coastline and fifteen times more sea than land space under its territory. The country relies heavily on its marine areas for economic prosperity, but the continued degradation of its coastal and ocean resources and ecosystems has been documented. Despite this, in its Voluntary National Review 2020 on the implementation of the SDGs, SDG 14 was not included. Having passed the mid-way point for SDG implementation, this paper explores the implementation status of SDG 14 in Trinidad and Tobago, and provides recommendations to achieve the SDG 14 targets. Of the four SDG 14 targets that matured in 2020, none has been achieved. However, some progress has been made towards achieving the targets and further opportunities exist, despite the many challenges faced by SIDS. Five key recommendations for Trinidad and Tobago to advance the SDG 14 agenda and achieve the goal within the current decade are provided.","Small Island Developing State; Sustainable Development Goal 14; Small Island State; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Trinidad And Tobago","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002363744"

Species are impacted by varying threats, although fishing pressure is the primary stressor causing population declines. Panama comprises both Pacific and Caribbean coastlines with a diversity of estuarine and marine habitats supporting small to large-scale fisheries. Understanding the status of chondrichthyans within this Central America seascape can help inform and drive conservation and research. This paper represents the first comprehensive review of the chondrichthyans of Panama and presents a summary of (1) species diversity and distribution; (2) habitat; (3) extinction risk; (4) drivers of extinction risk; and (5) policy tools. The study also discusses current research and critical knowledge gaps and outlines recommendations for research, education and management. Panama supports 112 species of chondrichthyan, the majority of which are associated with coastal and shelf environments. Almost half (47.3%) are at risk of extinction globally, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Many of the most frequently encountered species in fisheries are globally threatened, such as scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini and silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis. This review found a general lack of species-specific fisheries data, limiting the assessment of local population trends. Further, although national, regional and international policy tools are in place, deficiencies in monitoring, enforcement and compliance are limiting their effectiveness. Policies should aim to improve data collection and compliance with current management tools while supporting research into life-history, critical habitats and the socioeconomic values of chondrichthyans. Addressing the research, education and management recommendations within this paper would improve the status of Panama's chondrichthyans and assist the country in meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including SDG 14, which calls to ‘conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development’.","Cartilaginous Fishes; Conservation Management; Fisheries; Species Diversity; Threatened Species; Conservation Management; Conservation Status; Extinction Risk; Finfish; Habitat Management; Habitat Type; Red List; Spatial Distribution; Species Conservation; Species Diversity; Caribbean Islands; Pacific Ocean; Panama","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002114906"

This systematic literature review examines the integration of these technologies in coastal cities, emphasizing their role and effectiveness in IT-driven mitigation strategies for marine environmental administration while also exploring key barriers, enablers, and stakeholder perceptions regarding the implementation of smart marine environments. Despite the growing prevalence of marine ecological issues, there remains a notable lack of empirical evidence demonstrating the real-world effectiveness of these technologies. Additionally, comprehensive studies exploring stakeholder perceptions and addressing technological integration challenges are limited. This review aims to address these gaps by synthesizing existing research, identifying key barriers and enablers, and providing recommendations for future studies to enhance the adoption and effectiveness of smart marine technologies in coastal cities. To achieve this, a comprehensive search was conducted in ProQuest, EBSCO, and Scopus databases, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, and including 62 peer-reviewed research articles published from 2014 onwards. The review identified significant contributions of autonomous sensor networks in enhancing IT-driven mitigation strategies. Key barriers to implementation include technological limitations, excessive costs, and lack of stakeholder engagement. Conversely, enablers included technological advancements, supportive policy frameworks, and increased stakeholder awareness. To illustrate, advancements in sensor accuracy and data processing capabilities have shown potential in improving real-time environmental monitoring.","Autonomous Sensor Networks; Coastal Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Smart Marine Environments; Stakeholder Perceptions; Sustainable City; Autonomous Sensor Network; Autonomous Sensors; Coastal Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Marine Environment; Marine Technology; Sensors Network; Smart Marine Environment; Stakeholder Perception; Systematic Literature Review; Environmental Monitoring","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000261115"

To achieve this goal, we must rebuild the marine life-support systems that provide society with the many advantages of a healthy ocean. Therefore, countries worldwide have been using Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to restore, create, or protect habitats and ecosystems. Palau was one of the first countries to use MPAs as a tool to develop biodiversity within its exclusive economic zone. On 22 October 2015, Palau placed approximately 80% of its maritime territory in a network of locally monitored MPAs, which has now shown a population increase in stationary and migratory fish species. This movement towards a MPA was intentional and because of increased pressure from tourism and the increasing incursion of foreign fishing vessels in Palauan territorial waters. Since countries worldwide are using and looking towards MPAs, secondary protection projects are becoming more and more popular. This chapter highlights the practical implementations and results in Palau, how to theoretically apply this within the Greater North Sea in combination with Windmill Farms, and how the Marine Strategy Framework Directive stimulates these practices.","Greater North Sea; Marine Ecology; Marine Protected Areas; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Palau National Marine Sanctuary; Protected Area Networks; Spill-over Effect; Windmill Farms","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206275594"

This necessitates collaborative efforts on a global scale to protect, conserve, restore, and sustainably manage coastal ecosystems. In order to successfully implement this SDG, communities in coastal countries need to sustainably foster their response capacities and preparedness in the face of coastal multi-hazards. This can be achieved by establishing guidelines to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to tsunamis as well as by working with those communities to help them meet these guidelines and ultimately become ʻTsunami Readyʼ. This can be realized by raising awareness and increasing resilience amongst those communities and by devising preparedness strategies as required by Ocean Decade Challenge 6. This study investigates tsunami resilience and evacuation strategies along Alexandria's coastlines. It specifically focuses on the Bibliotheca Alexandrina's area, which is a site of immense historical, educational and residential significance. In this study, we leverage the results of tsunami modeling, coupled with advanced remote sensing and GIS techniques to identify risk zones, and design evacuation plans highlighting critical areas that require immediate attention during disaster preparedness.

The present study is focused on Gulf of Cambay which also known as Gulf of Khambhat with the objective to identify most susceptible zones to erosion and accretion. The shoreline extraction has been carried out from multitemporal satellite datasets for three years 2008, 2009, and 2010 consecutively. The high-tide line (HTL) is considered as shoreline. The visual interpretation of atmospherically corrected Landsat 5 satellite data has been used to demarcate the HTL on basis of geomorphology and land use & land cover features. The study area, deciphered three regions (A: Mahadevpur region, B: Vishwamitri river estuary, C: Gogha region near Bhavnagar) is eroded and accreted drastically. The cumulative erosion observed over a period of three years were 207.73 km2, 167.85 km2, and 48.94 km2 whereas deposition 91.03 km2, 20.9 km2, and 11.81 km2, over the region A, B, and C, respectively. The main reason for erosion were strong tidal currents accompanied by wave action. Situation of erosion is magnified by degradation of mangrove cover over mudflats whereas accretion is the result of the sediment load transportation & deposition from the various rivers, i.e., Mahi, Narmada, Sabarmati, Vishwamitri, Tapti rivers. The study covers the scope of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 14: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development”, Target 14.2 “sustainable manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans” and 14.5 “conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on best available scientific information”.","Accretion; Erosion; Gulf Of Khambhat; Sdgs; Shoreline Change; Coastal Zones; Ecosystems; Erosion; Landsat; Accretion; Gujarat; Gulf Of Khambhat; High Tides; River-habitats; Riverine Habitats; Sensitive Regions; Shoreline Change; Shoreline Change Analysis; Short Term; Rivers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206995040"

The self-designed velocimeter has advantages, such as simple operation, low cost, and easy maintenance. With wireless monitoring and an early warning system, it can monitor current velocity, flow direction, sea temperature, and displacement. The data is transmitted back to the operator through the radio transmission module as a basis for dispatching personnel to go out to sea for fishing. To prevent the set net from drifting into the open sea due to bad weather, a GPS module is used to monitor the current location of the set net. If the waves wash away the set net, the warning signal can be received the first time to prevent the floating set net from endangering the safety of ship navigation and the survival of marine life.

Not only do these activities threaten the future of biodiversity in these areas but they also affect the lives and livelihoods of the millions of people who depend on the high seas. It is therefore important to identify the research questions that need to be answered to overcome key knowledge gaps to ensure that we can adequately conserve, manage, and sustainably use our marine environments and resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Here we present the results of the high seas horizon scan conducted through an online survey of high seas researchers who were asked to identify and prioritise important questions for the future of the high seas. This horizon scan identified the ten most pressing research questions for the future of the high seas across each of the following eight themes: 1) governance, policy, and law, 2) climate change, 3) fisheries, 4) conservation and protection, 5) marine resources and activities, 6) ecosystems and biodiversity, 7) human rights and equity, and 8) science and innovation. As the United Nations negotiates an international Treaty to protect and sustainably manage the high seas, we hope to increase research and policy attention to these areas.

In response to these global livelihood and sustainability challenges, we developed an analytical framework calibrated to an actual fishery in the Torres Strait (Australia) to evaluate harvest control rules in relation to both economic objectives and stock resilience, as measured by robustness and recovery time. Our results showed that the Dynamic Maximum Economic Yield harvest control rule for this fishery generated both a larger expected net economic surplus and greater resilience than alternative and widely used Maximum Sustained Yield harvest control rules. Our analytical framework could be applied in other fisheries where data are available and offers the possibility of improved economic performance and resilience of marine capture fisheries.","Critical Stock Limit; Fishery Closure; Overfishing; Recovery Time; Robustness; Sand Fish; Sea Cucumber; Stock Target","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139722573"

This includes the cultivation of macroalgae to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which requires accurate estimates from the field. This study estimated the potential rates of carbon sequestration of cultivated macroalgae by quantifying the amount of biomass released into the environment from a kelp, Saccharina latissima, farm in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland (54.4° N, 5.58° W). We estimated that a mean of 41% of net primary productivity (NPP) of the cultivated kelp was lost prior to harvest following blade fall-off, equivalent to a mean of 7.4 kg of carbon sequestered per 100 m longline at the site during the cultivation period. Coarse estimates requiring verification predicted that a further 43.2% of NPP may have been lost through chronic erosion and exudation of organic carbon. This rate of sequestration is similar to that of several government-funded agroforestry schemes. There is potential, therefore, that this quantified ecosystem service could be subsidized to incentivize the sustainable development of the macroalgae industry. These findings are essential for those promoting the sustainable development of the macroalgae cultivation industry and are highly relevant for implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate action) and Goal 14 (Life below water: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”).","Carbon; Cultivated; Kelp; Macroalgae; Saccharina Latissima; Sequestration; Strangford Lough","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139528823"

The purpose of the study is scientific and practical re-search on the problem of sustainable development in the context of blue bioeconomy, the development of its theoretical and applied provisions and scientific tools. Based on the application of methods of analysis, synthesis and decomposition, the structure and patterns of the functioning and development of the world fisheries have been investigated. Furthermore, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the context of a blue bioeconomy have been specified. The use of methods of statistical and comparative analysis made it possible to identify the conditions and trends in the functioning and development of the global fisheries and aquaculture sector, to compare data on the dynamics of the global catch and population of the Earth, to assess the volume and structure of production, as well as the level of employment in the global fishing and fish farming sector. Based on the world statistics and analytics, the role of the fisheries and aquaculture sector in the implementation of sustainable development goals is shown. The SDG 14 (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development) and the Blue Growth initiative are emphasized. The basic characteristics of the Blue Growth initiative that are relevant in the context of the blue bioeconomy are highlighted. It is proved that for the development of the fisheries and aquaculture sector, it is necessary to competently regulate fisheries and apply methods in aquaculture that contribute to the sustainable use of resources and the conservation of aquatic biodiversity, that is, to act on the basis of the sound principles of the blue bio-economy.","Aquaculture; Blue Bioeconomy; Blue Growth Initiative; Fisheries; Goals; Sustainable Development; Biodiversity; Fisheries; Marine Biology; Planning; Population Statistics; Analysis/synthesis; Blue Bioeconomy; Blue Growth Initiative; Comparative Analyzes; Condition; Global Fisheries; Goal; Growth Initiatives; Methods Of Analysis; Scientific Tool; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139518720"

Human activities in combination with climate change exert a tremendous pressure on marine ecosystems and threaten their integrity, structure, and functioning. The protection of these ecosystems is a major target of the 14th United Nations sustainable development goal “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.” However, due to the complexity of processes and interactions of stressors, the status assessment of ecosystems remains a challenge. Holistic food web models, including biological and environmental data, could provide a suitable basis to assess ecosystem health. Here, we review climate change impacts on different trophic levels of coastal ecosystems ranging from plankton to ecologically and economically important fish and shellfish species. Furthermore, we show different food web model approaches, their advantages and limitations. To effectively manage coastal ecosystems, we need both a detailed knowledge base of each trophic level and a holistic modeling approach for assessment and prediction of future scenarios on food web-scales. A new model approach with a seamless coupling of physical ocean models and food web models could provide a future tool for guiding ecosystem-based management.","Ecosystem Effects; Ecosystem Models; Food Webs; Global Warming; Marine; Species Interactions","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111016895"

Within SDG-14, targets 14.1 and 14.2 deal with marine pollution and the adverse impacts of human activities on aquatic systems. Here, we present a remote-sensing-based analysis of short-term changes in the Vembanad-Kol wetland system in the southwest of India. The region has experienced high levels of anthropogenic pressures, including from agriculture, industry, and tourism, leading to adverse ecological and socioeconomic impacts with consequences not only for achieving the targets set out in SDG-14, but also those related to water quality (SDG-6) and health (SDG-3). To move towards the sustainable management of coastal and aquatic ecosystems such as Lake Vembanad, it is important to understand how both natural and anthropogenic processes affect water quality. In 2020, a unique opportunity arose to study water quality in Lake Vembanad during a period when anthropogenic pressures were reduced due to a nationwide lockdown in response to the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (25 March–31 May 2020). Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multi-spectral remote sensing and in situ observations to analyse changes in five different water quality indicators, we show that water quality improved in large areas of Lake Vembanad during the lockdown in 2020, especially in the more central and southern regions, as evidenced by a decrease in total suspended matter, turbidity, and the absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter, all leading to clearer waters as indicated by the Forel-Ule classification of water colour. Further analysis of longer term trends (2013–2020) showed that water quality has been improving over time in the more northern regions of Lake Vembanad independent of the lockdown. The improvement in water quality during the lockdown in April–May 2020 illustrates the importance of addressing anthropogenic activities for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources.","Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter; Global Development Goals; Lockdown; Remote Sensing; Sars-cov-2; Sustainable Management; Total Suspended Matter; Turbidity; Water Quality; Agricultural Robots; Aquatic Ecosystems; Economic And Social Effects; Lakes; Leisure Industry; Marine Biology; Marine Pollution; Planning; Remote Sensing; Sustainable Development; Tourism Industry; Water Absorption; Water Quality; Anthropogenic Activity; Anthropogenic Pressures; Anthropogenic Process; Coloured Dissolved Organic Matters; Socio-economic Impacts; Sustainable Management; Total Suspended Matter; Water Quality Indicators; Quality Control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105209675"

Some of these organisms have adverse effects, for example by reducing biodiversity and causing ecosystem shifts. Others have upsides, such as benefits to fisheries or replacing lost ecological functions and strengthening biogenic complexity. Stopping the spread of NIS is virtually impossible and so the societal challenge is how to limit the socioeconomic, health, and ecological risks, and sustainably exploit the benefits provided by these organisms. We propose a move away from the notion that NIS have only negative effects, and suggest a turn towards an Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management approach for NIS (EBFM-NIS) in the Mediterranean Sea, the world's most invaded marine region. A structured, iterative, and adaptive framework that considers the range of costs and benefits to ecosystems, ecosystem services, and fisheries is set out to determine whether NIS stocks should be managed using sustainable or unsustainable exploitation. We propose fishery reforms such as multiannual plans, annual catch limits, technical measures for sustainable exploitation, and legitimization of unlimited fishing of selected NIS and introduction of a radical new license for NIS fishing for unsustainable exploitation. Depending on local conditions, investment strategies can be included within the EBFM-NIS framework to protect/enhance natural assets to improve ecosystem resilience against NIS, as well as fishery assets to improve the performance of NIS fisheries. Examples of the former include the enhancement of Marine Protected Areas, harvesting of invasive NIS within MPAs, and protection of overfished predators and key species. Examples of the latter include market promotion and valorisation of NIS products, development of novel NIS products, and innovative/alternative NIS fishing such as fishery-related tourism (‘pescatourism’). The application of the suggested EBFM-NIS would create jobs, protect and enhance ecosystem services, and help to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.","Capital Assets; Ecosystem Services; Ecosystem-based Fishery Management; Invasive Alien Species; Marine Protected Areas; Biodiversity; Complexity; Ecosystem Resilience; Innovation; Marine Park; Performance Assessment; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Article; Fishery Management; Fishing; Introduced Species; Investment; Licence; Mediterranean Sea; Nonhuman; Predator; Sea; Sustainable Development; Tourism; Animal; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Fish; Fishery; Matthiola; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097046290"

As Sri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean, with rights to a vast sea area that extends from the shores, it is mandatory to sustainably manage its marine environment. Regular, systematic reviews of the state of marine environment provide an understanding of the various aspects of marine environment change and the implications for sustainability. Space borne platforms provide Earth observation data collected by different types of sensors, at regular intervals for the management of Earth environment. Earth observation data acquired with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology has become useful for the detection of marine pollution during the day and night, regardless of cloud covers. However, availability of near real-time data is important for prompt detection and response. Revisit time of a satellite is an important factor and satellite constellations are used to further improve revisit times, for example, Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite constellation can provide SAR data with a high revisit time. The research aims to explore the use of near real-time Sentinel-1 SAR data with automated mechanisms, for information extraction that supports early detection of abnormal vessels' behaviours and vessel sourced pollution in Sri Lanka's maritime zones.","Earth (planet); Ecosystems; Marine Radar; Observatories; Pollution Detection; Satellites; Signal Detection; Space Platforms; Space-based Radar; Sustainable Development; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Earth Environment; Earth Observation Data; Marine Environment; Maritime Zones; Near Real-time Datum; Near-real Time; Satellite Constellations; Systematic Review; Marine Pollution","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088506939"

Regional Fisheries Organizations (RFOs) play a key role in managing fisheries on the high seas and therefore are vital for supporting the successful implementation of SDG 14. SDG 14 is intrinsically linked with SDG 13 (the need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). As biophysical impacts arise from human-induced climate change affect oceans, and fisheries therein, it is important that RFOs take account of such impacts on the management of fisheries. This paper examines the engagement of RFOs with SDG 14 and climate change through an analysis of interviews with 36 RFO stakeholders. The results show that even though there is consensus concerning the importance of climate change and SDG 14, most of the RFOs are not directly engaging with these two SDGs. However, it was stated that the work done by RFOs, to end overfishing, positively contributes to the realization of climate change and SDG 14, although the actions taken by RFOs need to increase in scale and speed if they are to fulfil their responsibility to effectively manage human impacts on ocean resources. Furthermore, member countries play a key role in supporting or resisting progress. This paper contributes to a gap in the literature concerning current perceptions of stakeholders of the issues RFOs are facing concerning the SDG 14 and climate change.","Fisheries Management; High Seas; Stakeholder Perception; Sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079150590"

In this context, this article discusses whether the current international legal regime is adequate to encounter numerous challenges in achieving Goal 14, especially from the perspective of developing countries. It focuses on the utilization of marine genetic resources beyond national jurisdiction through marine scientific research activities in the field of marine biodiversity, which is also known as marine bioprospecting. This article argues that the current international legal regime concerning marine genetic resources beyond national jurisdiction is still heavily fragmented and inadequate to address the challenges in achieving Goal 14, especially in ensuring the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, small island developing states, and least developed countries.

Bathymetry data is critical for safety of navigation and is used for many other applications. In an era of ongoing environmental degradation worldwide, bathymetry data (and the knowledge derived from it) play a pivotal role in using and managing the world's oceans in a way that is in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14-conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. However, the vast majority of our oceans is still virtually unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored. Only a small fraction of the seafloor has been systematically mapped by direct measurement. The remaining bathymetry is predicted from satellite altimeter data, providing only an approximate estimation of the shape of the seafloor. Several global and regional initiatives are underway to change this situation. This paper presents a selection of these initiatives as best practice examples for bathymetry data collection, compilation and open data sharing as well as the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO (The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans) Seabed 2030 Project that complements and leverages these initiatives and promotes international collaboration and partnership. Several non-traditional data collection opportunities are looked at that are currently gaining momentum as well as new and innovative technologies that can increase the efficiency of collecting bathymetric data. Finally, recommendations are given toward a possible way forward into the future of seafloor mapping and toward achieving the goal of a truly global ocean bathymetry.","Bathymetry; Gebco; Mapping; Sdg14; Seabed 2030; Seafloor","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068581441"

In a relatively short time frame, the parties have committed to develop marine spatial planning, enforce sustainable management and protection of marine ecosystems, conserve at least 10% of the world's marine habitats, end overfishing, provide access for small-scale fishers, reduce marine pollution and ocean acidification, among others ambitious goals. The ocean has been included in the Paris Agreement, the subsequent Global Climate Action Agenda in 2015, and the 23rd Conference of the Parties of the UN (COP23), held in November 2017, which has assessed the global progress toward the SDG14, organizing several action plans. The UN seems optimistic with the progress achieved towards SDG 14, suggesting that overfishing has slowed down in the past 10 years and that over 8.4% of the world's exclusive economic zones are under protection. However, only a small fraction of that is under strong protection and many priority areas are still unprotected. In addition, major challenges presented by signatory governments are slowing down or compromising the achievement of the 14 SDG targets.

One of the tools to manage the world’s seas more sustainably is marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs are legally designated areas to protect and conserve valuable marine and coastal biodiversity and associated ecosystem services and cultural values. The recent pace of MPA designation and coverage has resulted in large increases in global MPA coverage, currently at 6.4%. However, most of this area concentrates in few huge offshore MPAs designated by few countries and lacks effective management. MPAs can be effective at preventing important local pressures such as overexploitation of marine resources or habitat destruction, but may be of little or no use to tackle some broad-scale marine pressures such as pollution or global warming. Although legal stringency is a broadly acknowledged factor for MPA environmental effectiveness, their ecological and socioeconomic effects are very context-specific and trade-offs among environmental features, between environmental and socioeconomic effects, and among socioeconomic stakeholders, are expected. Future marine conservation challenges include increasing demand for marine resources, global change, and scarce management budgets. In contrast, positive trends in MPA coverage, aquaculture production, and water quality make us slightly optimistic on the future of our oceans. Nevertheless, ultimate sustainability of the world’s seas will very much depend on global human population, consumption, and behavioral patterns.","Marine Conservation; Marine Management; Marine Reserve; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081530861"

Challenges for the implementation of marine SDGs include how to reduce the impacts of land-based activities, strengthen integrated coastal management, improve marine resource efficiency, enhance climate change adaptation, and thus improve human well-being for coastal zone residents. To address these challenges, ocean and coasts should be integrated as a whole ecosystem and marine and coastal ecosystem-based management should be applied to take into account the cumulative impacts from multi- sectors and different stressors. Ecosystem services provided by ocean and coasts can be improved by setting up integrated marine observation system, performing reasonable marine zoning, reducing human activities based on the carrying capacity of marine environment, and ensuring reasonable allocation and use of marine resources. All these measures can move forward the implementation of marine Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","Coastal Ecosystem; Ecosystem-based Management (ebm); Land-ocean Integration; Marine Ecosystem; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Climate Change; Coastal Zone; Coastal Zone Management; Ecosystem Management; Ecosystem Service; Human Activity; Land-sea Interaction; Marine Ecosystem; Marine Resource; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; United Nations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040222911"

The study assessed perceptions of governance of marine and coastal resources among national and provincial authorities and Koh Tao residents on the basis of governance components − law, institutions and process − and governance principles − transparency, participation, rule of law, accountability and access to justice. Governance to deal with the anticipated continued growth in marine-based tourism is challenged. The study identified misunderstandings about governance and governance weaknesses, which, if they are not addressed, will be obstacles to the future sustainable development of Koh Tao. The research findings indicate that supporting local governance will be key to maintaining sustainable use of marine and coastal resources on the island and ensuring the sustainability of the local economy, which depends on these resources. We suggest a number of recommendations that can apply generally in countries wishing to conserve marine and coastal biodiversity and use those resources sustainably on coasts and islands.","Governance; Marine And Coastal Resources; Small Island; Thailand; Biodiversity; Sustainable Development; Coastal Resources; Governance; Gulf Of Thailand; Local Economy; Small Island; Sustainable Use; Thailand; Natural Resources; Accountability; Assessment Method; Biodiversity; Governance Approach; Local Economy; Marine Resource; Small Island State; Sustainable Development; Tourism Development; Koh Tao; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Southern Region; Surat Thani [southern Region]","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027398078"

Despite their importance, through a tragedy-of-the-commons effect, our oceans are becoming increasingly stressed. Addressing such issues of the commons require a collaborative international approach, as evidenced by the United Nations sustainable development goal 14 to &quot;conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources&quot; [1] and the IAMU Tasmanian Statement [2]. This paper will explore what makes individuals (and organizations) move from awareness to action when it comes to protecting our oceans. It will propose a theoretical framework by which to test the most effective means of motivating action to protect the ocean environment. The framework will be based upon a non-equivalent group quasi-experimental design [3], [4] which will be used to assess the relative effects of treatments that have been nonrandomly assigned to participants from around the world. Both the treatment and control groups will be subject to pre- and post-testing using an awareness assessment [5], such as the one developed by the Ocean Literacy Project [6]. Several treatments will be explored, including examples such as behavioral conservation [7], to determine the most effective means to be used by NGOs in ocean advocacy. Informed by a review of the literature, this theoretical paper will provide the evidence-based research method for testing and measuring what motivates people to take action toward protecting our oceans.","Advocacy; Conservation; Ngo; Non-equivalent Group Design; Oceans; Sustainability; Conservation; Marine Biology; Sustainable Development; Advocacy; Evidence Based Researches; Group Design; Ocean Environment; Oceans; Quasi-experimental Designs; Theoretical Framework; Tragedy Of The Commons; Oceanography","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044431247"

Further, the IAMU recognizes the importance of this aspect of their mission as evidenced by the Tasmanian Statement [2] and also by the theme of their 2016 annual general assembly calling for submissions about ""strengthening cooperation for protection of the ocean environment"" [3]. Using the collaborative value creation (CVC) framework [4, 5], this paper describes how IAMU might form a partnership with various INTERMEPA (the International Marine Environmental Protection Association) member associations to jointly advance their mutual shared mission to ""save our seas"" [6]. Using the CVC framework, this paper will describe a pathway for partner selection, partnership implementation, design and operations, and institutionalization. Building upon the foundation of success experienced by NAMEPA (the North American MEPA), this paper will also explore the opportunity to utilize IAMU member network connections to fulfil a critical objective listed under the Tasmanian Statement and create a new MEPA chapter in Japan (NIPPONMEPA) as a case study using the CVC framework. Proposed activities will likely include identified effective practices and may include new innovations such as joint events conducted virtually using the MIX methodology [7].","Cooperation; Oceans; Partnership; Protection Of Maritime Environment; Sustainability; Marine Biology; Mergers And Acquisitions; Oceanography; Sustainable Development; Collaborative Approach; Cooperation; Design And Operations; Effective Practices; Maritime Environment; Network Connection; Oceans; Partnership; Environmental Protection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009126449"
