Design/methodology/approach: The research uses data spanning from 1996–2022 and uses the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model. This model allows for the assessment of the short and long-term effects of remittance inflow (RI) growth, control on corruption and employment rate (ER) on poverty reduction in India. Findings: The research findings indicate that in the short run, an increase in international RIs, a higher control of corruption and a greater ERare associated with a decrease in poverty in India. Specifically, a positive change in RIs and control of corruption significantly reduces poverty, while an increase in the ERhas a substantial impact. However, in the long run, only a positive change in RIs and a higher control of corruption continue to significantly reduce poverty. Originality/value: This study makes several significant contributions to the existing literature. First, it examines the simultaneous impact of three structural factors on poverty, offering insights into their combined long-term effects on the economy. Second, unlike previous studies, this research investigates the nonlinear effects on poverty, which is particularly relevant for developing nations. Lastly, this study aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 1, which aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The findings of this study are expected to assist Indian policymakers in formulating effective poverty eradication strategies and provide guidance for other developing nations facing similar challenges.","Corruption; Employment; India; Poverty; Remittances; Sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001402127"

One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they.’ So Rousseau wrote in The Social Contract. It was for the sake of liberating men from these chains (chains which Rousseau thought could be made ‘legitimate’) that Marx became a radical critic of society; it was in the name of freedom, and not of security, that Marx turned to communism. The vision before his eyes, from his youth onward, was that of the creative, self-determined man, master of his environment, of the universe, and of himself, co-operating, spontaneously and harmoniously, with all other men as ‘aspects’ of the human spirit liberated within him. ‘Dignity’, the young Marx wrote in a secondary school essay, ‘can be afforded only by that position in which we do not appear as servile instruments’; 1 ‘the criticism of religion’, he said in the Deutsch- französische Jahrbücher nine years later (1844), ‘ends in the teaching that man is the highest being for man, it ends, i.e., with the categorical imperative to overthrow all conditions in which man is a debased, forsaken, contemptible being forced into servitude’. 2 Communism, for Marx, meant neither the mere abolition of poverty nor that abstract application of fairness which he rejected so scathingly in his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875) — the triumph of distributive justice in social affairs. Least of all did Marx see communism as a form of state socialism in which governmental or ‘representative’ power and authority replaced individual power and authority over men. Ultimately more consistent than Rousseau, Marx implicitly rejected any possible justification for the ‘chains’ that bind men together; in the belief that Rousseau’s general, universal will could and would flower in history, Marx confidently predicted that all social chains would wither away. Communism would be the society of freedom, in which man became the subject and ceased to be the object of power. No longer would man’s nature and actions be determined by something outside himself, either by the state, society, man’s social situation, his animal needs, or by other men. No longer would man’s fellow human beings confront him as competitors, enslaving him and themselves to the inexorable demands of competitive economic life. For the first time in human history, society, technology and the whole range of human conduct and relations would become expressions of man’s true being and cease to be limitations upon that being. In his own life, man would find that true and ultimate freedom which is the necessary destiny of man; in other men he would find partners in that spontaneous but cooperative creativity that distinguishes man as a universal and social being from the animal as a limited and particular one. Man would become praxis — the subject and not the object of history.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77449088162"

The ultimate goal of Agenda 2030 is to end poverty and inequality, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy health, justice and prosperity by 2030. The global healthcare sector has gained attention as an essential component in accomplishing SDG3 which focuses on good health and wellbeing. The global tourism sector has aligned itself with SDG1 which focuses on zero poverty in all its forms everywhere. Additionally, SDG12 focuses on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, which is key to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations. This paper aims to present a model to strengthen to healthcare sector in South Africa to improve medical tourism to the region in order to achieve the SDG goals highlighted. South Africa already has a robust medical tourism sector as the private healthcare sector is able to provide cost effective solutions and shorter waiting times for specific medical procedure. South Africa's private healthcare system is world-class for medical tourism because it is supported by a thriving medical insurance market. However, the public healthcare system has not been able to benefit from the current synergies between to medical tourism and private healthcare sector. Upgrading and expanding the healthcare sector may lead to improvements and growth in both the sectors and better achievement of the SDG goals. A study was conducted in the South African Healthcare sector using mixed methods to collect data from a purposive sample while adhering to a descriptive exploratory paradigm. A comprehensive questionnaire was administered to 322 participants who worked in frontline positions at selected public healthcare facilities in South Africa. The data showed that frontline healthcare personnel experience daily struggles and challenges that limit their ability to provide high-quality of service. Based on the results of this study, this paper will present a model for improving the quality of healthcare service delivery in an effort to provide improved and expanded services to the medical tourism industry.","Challenges In Healthcare; Medical Tourism; Public Health; Service Delivery; Sustainable Development Goals","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008209737"

This study also investigates the role of partnerships (SDG 17) in sharing resources and knowledge while adopting decarbonization practices to achieve SDG1. Leveraging SDG17 to meet SDG1 and the overall business model, this study introduces the concept of poverty alleviation business models. This study analyzed 172 articles published between 1990 and 2024 from the Scopus database and Google Scholar using descriptive, bibliometric, and network analyses as well as content analysis. The results highlight that CA helps firms develop decarbonization strategies to promote sustainable practices for SDG1 based on partnerships. This study also highlights that TCA evaluates the economic, social, and environmental impacts of firms' activities, enabling sustainable decision-making and identifying opportunities for poverty alleviation business models. This study provides a pioneering analysis of corporate decarbonization by examining how firms can develop a balanced business model that integrates economic, environmental, and social goals, specifically SDG1. This study explores on the one hand CA and TCA as managerial tools for measuring decarbonization practices through new technologies and renewable resources and, on the other hand, SDG17, particularly Target 17.G, to advance SDG1.

The neglect of rIDPs could impede the progress toward sustainable development. This study aimed to estimate the disease burden of rIDPs in 2021, which would be pivotal for setting intervention priorities and mobilizing resources globally. Methods: Leveraging data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, the study reported both numbers and age-standardized rates of prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years lived with disability, and years of life lost of rIDPs with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) at global, regional, and national levels. The temporal trends between 1990 and 2021 were assessed by the joinpoint regression analysis. A Bayesian age-period-cohort model was used to project the disease burden for 2050. Results: In 2021, there were 103.76 million (95% UI: 102.13, 105.44 million) global population suffered from rIDPs with an age-standardized DALY rate of 58.44 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 42.92, 77.26 per 100,000 population). From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized DALY rates showed an average annual percentage change of − 0.16% (95% confidence interval: − 0.22, − 0.11%). Higher age-standardized DALY rates were dominated in sub-Saharan Africa (126.35 per 100,000 population, 95% UI: 91.04, 161.73 per 100,000 population), South Asia (80.80 per 100,000 population, 95% UI: 57.31, 114.10 per 100,000 population), and countries with a low socio-demographic index. There was age heterogeneity in the DALY rates of rIDPs, with the population aged under 15 years being the most predominant. Females aged 15–49 years had four-times higher age-standardized DALY rates of rIDPs than males in the same age. The projections indicated a slight reduction in the disease burden of rIDPs by 2050. Conclusions: There has been a slight reduction in the disease burden of rIDPs over the past three decades. Given that rIDPs mainly affect populations in impoverished regions, targeted health strategies and resource allocation are in great demand for these populations to further control rIDPs and end poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Although children experience poverty differently from adults and their needs and expectations are different, child poverty is rarely differentiated from adult poverty, and its special dimensions are often recognised. For the first time, as part of the SDGs, countries have committed to addressing child poverty specifically and directly, which is not derived from household poverty. This article aims to measure multidimensional child specific poverty in India in response to such global norms and trends focusing on the child rather than the household as a whole. We utilise the data collected in the third wave of “Children’s Worlds Survey, 2016–19” for India, which was conducted in the metro city of Kolkata in place of all over the country, bearing in mind the financial as well as the time constraints. This survey allows the yardstick of deprivation informed by subjective opinion of the children, the measure which takes us deeper into the ‘rights based’ approach. Measuring child specific poverty with this approach in the Indian context has not been attempted so far. This article is an effort to contribute to this end. We intend to identify the multidimensional poor school-going 8 years old children from the perspective of themselves following the dual cut-offs approach proposed by Alkire and Foster in 2011. Also, it allows us empirically test three issues like, (i) if the status of these children to be multidimensional poor is significantly gender (boys/girls) sensitive, (ii) if does it depend significantly on the region (northern/southern) the children belong to, and, (iii) if does it depend significantly on the type of school (government/private) the children are enrolled. Our findings show that in the metro city of Kolkata more than fifty percent of 8 years old children, enrolled in government schools, are multidimensional poor, whereas, the situation of private schools are quite better. This is alarming in terms of fulfillment of Sustainable Development Goal 1 targeting the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions. However, we do not find significant gender bias while significant regional disparity is evidenced from our test results.","Adult; Article; Child; Child Poverty; Epidemiology; Gender Bias; Government; Household; Human; Male; Poverty; School; School Child; Sustainable Development Goal; Time Pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199303545"

However, some researchers recently have argued that there isn't much data to support this statement, while foreign direct investment is significantly impacted by crime, it is still unclear how poverty and crime are connected. The main aim of this article is to examine whether there is direct link between poverty and crime in South Africa, this was deemed necessary considering that South Africa has the third highest crime rates in the world and suffers from severe poverty. Therefore, it is imperative to ascertain if the severe poverty correlate with the increasing crime rate in the country. This article was underpinned by the United Nations (UN) first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end poverty in all its forms everywhere as well as the South African National Developmental Plan (NDP) that envisages the elimination of poverty and safer communities in the South African milieu by 2030.To ensure that the aim of this article was achieved, the use of a systematic literature review was utilized as research methodology, which assisted the researchers in identifying patterns in documents and communication artifacts which were applicable in answering the questions of this article. To conduct the systematic review the researchers systematically collected data from various sources including journal articles, newspaper articles, books, and search engines. Even though documents are a significant source of data, the researchers cautiously and critically examined every document.Thus, the researchers searched for pertinent studies published between the years 2019 to 2023 in the search engines Google Scholar, Web of Science, Google, SciELO and EBSCO search engine. The search terms which were used included, poverty and crime in South Africa, the nexus between poverty and crime in South Africa, contributing factors to crime in South Africa, socio-economic factors and crime in South Africa and the link between poverty and crime in South Africa. The findings of this article indicate a strong association between poverty and crime in South Africa; these findings suggests that if poverty is eliminated in the country, then a considerable fraction of all crimes can be avoided. Consequently, a more concerted effort is required from the government and civil societies to reduce poverty in South Africa.","Crime; Poverty; Social Causes Of Crime; South Africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211150286"

Realising the importance of lowering global poverty, the United Nations incorporated ‘End poverty in all its forms everywhere’ as the first of the 17 SDGs for Sustainable Development. This background motivates us to look into how different lower-middle- or lower-income countries are achieving the first SDG goal. Consequently, the study primarily investigates the efficiency of 43 lower middle- or lower-income countries in Asia, Africa, and America in reaching the SDG goal of ‘No poverty’ by using the Stochastic Production Frontier from 2019 to 2020. Concurrently, the analysis pinpoints the causes of the nation’s inefficiency in accomplishing that objective. According to the study’s findings the Korea Republic is the most efficient nation at reaching the objective of ‘No poverty.’ Guinea is the least efficient. In conjunction with inefficiency issues, the analysis demonstrates that rising CO2 emissions paradoxically promote efficiency in the battle against poverty; conversely, rising corruption increases inefficiency. Conflict significantly impedes any constructive goal, such as poverty reduction. Corruption and intentional homicides serve as proxy indicators of conflict in this context. A rise in conflict variables reduces the nation’s efficacy in lowering poverty rates. The article ends by outlining future research goals and making pertinent policy recommendations.","Co2 Emission; Corruption; Developing Nations; No Poverty; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Sustainable Development Goals; Carbon Emission; Corruption; Developing World; Poverty; Stochasticity; Sustainable Development Goal; Africa; Asia; Central America","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198325610"

Health systems are a significant determinant of the risk of impoverishment and financial hardship. We review methods for calculating catastrophic health spending and impoverishing spending, noting a distinction between those who are impoverished by out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending and those who are further impoverished by OOP health spending. Catastrophic health spending tends to be concentrated among poor households, but there is a high level of variability between countries. In particular, countries with higher public spending on health as a share of GDP have lower OOP spending, which in turn is associated with lower catastrophic health spending and impoverishment. Policymakers can also make progress on reducing the risk of impoverishment by making reforms to coverage policies. We conceptualise progress towards universal health coverage through an analysis of the coverage of people, services, and costs. Risk of financial hardship is minimised when the entire population is covered, the right services are covered to meet the population’s health needs, and costs are financed largely through pre-payment with risk pooling to avoid high user charges. The most successful systems use user charges sparingly, design user charges as fixed copayments rather than percentage-based coinsurance, and include income-based exemptions and OOP maximums.","Co-benefits; Europe; Financial Protection; Poverty; Sustainable Development Goals; Universal Health Coverage; Cost Benefit Analysis; Economics; Environmental Protection; Health Risks; Sustainable Development Goals; Cobenefits; Coverage Designs; Europe; Financial Protection; Health Systems; Policy Makers; Poor Households; Poverty; Universal Health Coverage; User Charges; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010070762"

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 aims to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere” but a global uniform approach has not been found rather than country-specific programs that tackle poverty with international initiatives to support them toward the SDG poverty eradication goal. With the opportunities generated by the 4th Industrial Revolution, nations can optimize their economic strengths to end poverty. Since the textile industry is one of the economic power engines of many developing countries, optimal strategic enhancements can feasibly ignite unexplored potentials with the emerging 4th Industrial Revolution technologies. With the rapid technological infrastructural developments, cloud computing has powered up lots of e-commerce businesses that enhance distribution of textile products. The problem is that there is no feedback channel for local and global customers to share their experience with the textile product developers and distributors, and this limits the marketing potentials of the textile producers and distributors locally and globally. In this work, we propose and demonstrate an explainable data-driven solution that optimizes 4th industrial Artificial Intelligence potentials and Natural Language Processing to boost textile product development and distribution. Our proposed Artificial Intelligence approach to sentiment analysis transparently explains evolving customer sentiments and preferences for textile products and provides insights for textile product development, personalized marketing, and distribution of textile garments for women.","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xai); Personalized Marketing; Sentiment Analysis; Technology Adoption And Management; Textile Industry; Commerce; Developing Countries; Product Development; Sentiment Analysis; Sustainable Development; Textiles; Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xai); Global Challenges; Industrial Revolutions; Personalized Marketings; Poverty Eradication; Technology Adoption; Technology Managements; Textile Products; United Nations; Textile Industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164968596"

The United Nations has identified the eradication of poverty worldwide as the first priority of its Sustainable Development Goals. However, poverty in old age is not given a specific place in this effort, despite the fact that developed societies are all ageing, with an increasing proportion of the population over 65 years. Financial insecurity in old age can lead to poverty and social exclusion, which is largely a matter for the pension system to prevent and tackle, and to a lesser extent for financial readiness and conscious preparation. In our study, we address the relationship between old age poverty and financial awareness, using data from 25 European countries to identify groups that can be considered similar from aspects of poverty, pension systems, macroeconomic factors, and some aspects of financial awareness. Using clustering, we found that the countries studied can be divided into four distinct clusters, with all combinations of financial readiness and old age poverty. The results could help decision makers identify intervention points to reduce poverty in old age.","Cluster Analysis; Financial Awareness; Old Age Poverty; Share; Decision Making; Finance; Clusterings; European Countries; Financial Awareness; Not Given; Old Age; Old Age Poverty; Pension System; Share; Social Exclusion; United Nations; Cluster Analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163445318"

This paper explores this problem through the inquiry into the measurement of multidimensional poverty in Sustainable Development Goal 1 (""End poverty in all its forms everywhere""). In the field historically dominated by the World Bank's dollar-per-day metric (currently 1.9$), multidimensional poverty measurement gained prominence, becoming one of the key measures of global poverty. By tracking the pathways to success of multidimensional poverty measurement - through qualitative interviews with actors in International Organisations this paper argues that the key quality of successful indicators is their ability to become parts of the broader epistemic infrastructure, linking political institutions, actors (including experts and policymakers), and data and statistics. The paper brings the focus on a specific set of actors - statistical entrepreneurs - who advocate for innovations in measurement and work toward creating such infrastructures, thus indirectly promoting new policy ideas reflected in the metrics.","Epistemic Infrastructure; Indicators; Multidimensional Poverty; Quantification; Sdgs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145191912"

Many of the world's poor and vulnerable people live in or near forests and rely on trees and other natural resources to support their livelihoods. Effectively tackling poverty and making progress toward the first of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere” must therefore consider forests and trees. But what do we know about the potential for forests and tree-based systems to contribute to poverty alleviation? This Special Issue responds to this question. It synthesises and presents available scientific evidence on the role of forests and tree-based systems in alleviating and, ultimately, eradicating poverty. The articles compiled here also develop new conceptual frameworks, identify research frontiers, and draw out specific recommendations for policy. The scope is global, although emphasis is placed on low- and middle-income countries where the majority of the world's poorest people live. This introductory article stakes out the conceptual, empirical and policy terrain relating to forests, trees and poverty and provides an overview of the contribution of the other seven articles in this collection.

Mobile phone ownership (MPO) can play a key role in bridging this digital divide and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”, “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”, and “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. Administrative district-level infrastructural and societal readiness to women's MPO in rural settings of Bangladesh may also influence the geospatial variation in their MPO status, which is still unexplained. In the context of rural Bangladesh, household heads substantially exert influence over women's decision-making process. However, the role of household heads' age and education on women's MPO is mostly unexplored. As in developing countries, women's MPO does not ensure its usage, investigating the possibilities of women's MPO on its usage has immense importance. Therefore, this study aims to revisit the correlates of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh and explain the administrative district-level geospatial variation in their MPO by controlling the effect of individual and household-level sociodemographic correlates of MPO. Further, this study attempts to investigate the possibilities of MPO on the extent of its usage. This study used the latest nationally representative cross-sectional data from Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019. This study reveals that the district-level readiness was a potential source of geospatial variation in the prevalence of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh. The lowest level of readiness was noticed in north-western Bangladesh. Comparatively elderly women with better education and media exposure had a considerably higher chance of MPO. Elderly household heads, especially male and less educated heads, hindered the MPO of women. This study identified MPO as a key determinant of its extent of usage. Moreover, to increase the MPO by a faster pace, strategies should target less empowered women, particularly those who lived in districts of lower readiness.","Determinants; Digital Divide; Empowerment; Geospatial Heterogeneity; Mobile Phone; Rural Bangladesh; Decision Making; Developing Countries; Bangladesh; Determinant; Digital Divide; Empowerment; Geo-spatial; Geospatial Heterogeneity; Information And Communication Technologies; Multilevels; Rural Bangladesh; Rural Women; Cellular Telephones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121907208"

The major indicator to monitor the goal is the so-called headcount ratio or poverty rate, i.e., proportion or percentage of people under poverty. In India, where nearly a quarter of population still live below the poverty line, monitoring of poverty needs greater attention, more frequently at shorter intervals (e.g., every year) to evaluate the effectiveness of planning, programs and actions taken by the governments to eradicate poverty. Poverty rate computation for India depends on two basic ingredients - rural and urban poverty lines for different states and union territories and average Monthly Per-capita Consumer Expenditure (MPCE). While MPCE can be obtained every year, usually from the Consumer Expenditure Survey on shorter schedules with a few exceptions where the information is obtained from another survey, determination of poverty lines is a highly complex, costly and time-consuming process. Poverty lines are essentially determined by a panel of experts who draws their conclusions partly based on their subjective opinions and partly based on data from multiple sources. The main data source the panel uses is the Consumer Expenditure Survey data with a detailed schedule, which are usually available every five years or so. In this paper, we undertake a feasibility study to explore if estimates of headcount ratios or Poverty Ratios in intervening years can be provided in absence of poverty lines by relating poverty ratios with average MPCE through a statistical model. Then we can use the fitted model to predict poverty rates for intervening years based on average MPCE. We explore a few in this work models using Bayesian methodology. The reason behind calling this ‘synthetic prediction' rests on the synthetic assumption of model invariance over years, often used in the small area literature. While the data-based assessment of our Bayesian synthetic prediction procedure is encouraging, there is a great potential for improvements on the models presented in this paper, e.g., by incorporating more auxiliary data as they become available. In any case, we expect our preliminary work in this important area will encourage researchers to think about statistical modeling as a possible way to at least partially solve a problem for which no objective solution is currently available.","Bayesian Beta Regression; Consumer Expenditure Surveys; Data Integration; Poverty; Sustainable Development Goals; Synthetic Prediction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160953979"

In understanding societal challenges involving adequate nutrition and abolishment of hunger and disease, linkages are being sought between a research agenda and sustainable development that promote the cooperation of communities. The small-scale livestock producers have struggled with sustaining their productivity amidst food-borne neglected tropical diseases, poor husbandry systems, and modernization of traditional ways of rearing their livestock on one hand, and on the other, ensuring a sustainable livelihood and feeding people. While widespread traditional pig production continues to be the hallmark of resiliency in providing livelihoods of the rural population, existing production challenges require an improvement in ways of raising indigenous pigs in averting hunger, and where applicable, taking advantage of IK and associated methodologies. Efforts aimed at replacing indigenous breeds with unsuitable exotic breeds or crossbreeding have had mixed results as the farmers and their communities believe their indigenous ways still have a place in the sustainability of the enterprises. Striking a balance between the adoption of modernized animal livestock practices and its potential for increased productivity and disease control strategies, and taking into consideration experiences, and practices that, if desirable to fight hunger, can encourage communities to take research outcomes seriously. Such adoptions may lead to sustainable initiatives that are locally driven. While the fight against hunger may be the focus of SDG #2, the SDGs will remain integrated in terms of neglected tropical diseases. This is because any action done to achieve any of them, particularly SDG 1 “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” and SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” affects outcomes in others. To achieve any meaningful progress, any development must balance aspects of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Considering the wealth of IK and the pursuit of the social value of research, approaches are being modified to improve a community-based inquiry and application.","Indigenous Knowledge; Intangible Cultural Heritage; One Health; Sustainable Development Goals; Taenia Solium","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140759785"

Many rural people experiencing poverty often rely on forests and tree-based systems, such as agroforestry, suggesting the existence of links between such systems and poverty outcomes. This paper reviews the evidence of such links across multiple dimensions of poverty and well-being, based on an expert panel convened by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) and an extensive literature search. We consider whether, how, where, when, and for whom forests and trees in the wider landscape influence poverty dynamics. We organize the evidence according to four pathways through which forests and trees influence household poverty dynamics: 1) helping households move out of poverty; 2) maintaining well-being levels through subsistence, food security, health, and cultural and spiritual values; 3) preventing declines by mitigating risks and stabilizing consumption; 4) decreasing well-being by generating negative externalities that could trap or move households into poverty. We found that local context matters considerably, with the roles of forests and trees strongly varying across geographical, social, economic, and political settings. Another key finding is that evidence of forests and trees providing livelihood diversification and benefits that help households move out of poverty remains limited, based primarily on a small number of case studies. Evidence on the impact of gender gaps in relation to forest landscapes and poverty pathways is also lacking. However, our findings do suggest that ecosystem services provided by forests and trees play critical roles in maintaining well-being and food security and have the potential to contribute more to helping households move out of poverty and mitigating risks amplified by climate change. This review also highlights cautionary findings related to negative forest externalities that can maintain or move households into poverty. Together, these findings call for policy efforts to support the conservation and sustainable management of forest landscapes and agroforestry systems that are more targeted towards meeting the diverse needs of the rural poor. Our results also point to a need for greater effort to address gender disparities, which have been largely overlooked yet provide a critical opportunity to not only enhance gender equality but also advance sustainable poverty reduction goals.","Agroforestry; Forest Policy; Livelihoods; Poverty Alleviation; Poverty Dynamics; Sustainable Development; Climate Change; Ecosystems; Food Supply; Forestry; Health Risks; Planning; Sustainable Development; Agroforestry; Food Security; Forest Landscape; Forest Policy; Livelihood; Mitigating Risk; Poverty Alleviation; Poverty Dynamic; Tree-based; Well Being; Dynamics; Food; Forests; Trees; United Nations","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112482815"

They are key agents in the education of future leaders that will contribute to the successful United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation. The geography of SDGs this implementation is very heterogeneous, but it is clear that higher education institutions contribute decisively to creating a mindset that facilitates the dissemination of SDGs principle. This perspective paper analyses the impacts of higher education on sustainability and the challenges and barriers associated with this process. Higher education contributes decisively to the SDGs implementation, but especially to Goal 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere), Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), Goal 5 (gender equality), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (climate change) and Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). As a transformational agent, the higher education sector has a tremendous impact on students' habit and contribution to a prosperous society. However, to establish the required change in education, sustainability principles need to be at the heart of higher institutions strategy (e.g., curricula, modus operandi) and is key to be incorporated in the organisational culture. Only by leading by example, the external influence in the society will be possible (e.g., implementing SDGs key aspects such as gender quality, reduce waste reduction and energy consumption). For this to be a reality, different communication methods with students are needed (e.g., different student academic levels). Nevertheless, critical challenges need to be tackled in the institutions inside and outside the institution environment, such as incorporating sustainability principles, political environment and stakeholders' interest.","Communication; Higher Education Institutions; Organisational Culture; Sustainability; Communication; Higher Education; Organization; Student; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110365521"

In Vietnam, poverty eradication in ethnic minorities and mountainous areas are among the top priorities. This study aims to learn about farmers’ livelihoods associated with perceived difficulties in Chau Thai Commune, Nghe An Province, a rural mountainous area in Vietnam. A random sampling technique and a face-to-face interview method were employed to conduct a field survey in the region in 2018. The dataset collected from 215 households shows that Chau Thai Commune's livelihood largely depends on agriculture and forestry. Plantation forest and livestock are major sources of farmers’ income while forestland accounts for over 90% of households’ land. Besides, the disparity in livelihood in areas such as forestland, labor and income between the poor and non-poor households is reported. This primary data could be useful for scholars who want to conduct a further in-depth study and or experts, policymakers who work in Vietnam's ‘New Rural Development’ program to devise a better rural livelihood -improvement policy for farmers, particularly the poor in the uplands of Vietnam and beyond.","Plantation Forests; Primary Data; Rural Livelihood; Sustainable Rural Development; Vietnam","Data paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104054915"

While the decline of global poverty continues, progress has slowed and remains uneven through different parts of the world. To ensure that no one is left behind in China and beyond, research will be critical to inform paths out of poverty. In this regard, it is valuable to take stock of international experiences and the various pathways out of poverty with a focus on agriculture. Africa's agricultural growth has been largely driven by land expansion and poverty reduction has been the slowest among all regions. South Asia agriculture has been led by diversification of smallholder agriculture and its poverty reduction impact has been large, but its future poverty reduction is limited by rural–urban migration and lack of formal jobs in urban centers. Social protection programs have been used by many Latin American countries as the region is more urbanized than any other developing regions. China's agricultural and economic success was driven by agriculture-led reforms and rural development. These changes brought significantly higher incomes among rural residents, which accounted for highest initial levels of poverty and hunger, and in increased availability of food at affordable prices. Investments in nutrition, health, education, clean water, and good sanitation also complemented progress. The foremost lesson is that smallholder-led agriculture growth in land scarce countries often have the largest impact on poverty reduction. Secondly, nonfarm employment and rural–urban migration must follow once agricultural productivity has reached a certain level. However, premature exiting from agriculture can do more harm. Thirdly, even before large scale poverty reduction through sectoral and regional development is exhausted, social safety nets must be established to cover those who have not benefited from growth and development. Productive social safety nets have proven to be cost-effective in many countries. Urban poverty should also be part of the protection scheme when large proportion of rural population moves to cities.","Agricultural Transformation; Agriculture; Food Systems; Poverty; Sustainable Development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103097670"

Poverty goes hand in hand with their situation of vulnerability, exclusion and disempowerment. How can this situation be changed? How to find adequate frameworks able to facilitate the overturn of their structural disenfranchisement? Departing from the jurisprudence developed by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACrtHR), this paper argues that the recognition of indigenous peoples’ right to collective property over their traditional lands and natural resources constitutes the most adequate strategy for poverty reduction that takes into consideration their own cultural distinctiveness. In fact, indigenous peoples’ special connection with their lands and territories is essential for both their material and cultural survival. Without access to their lands and natural resources, indigenous peoples are not only condemned to structural poverty conditions but they are also deprived of the necessary conditions for a life in dignity, that is, a life that takes into consideration their own world’s views and cultural understandings. In other words, in the case of indigenous peoples, the recognition and effective realization of their land rights constitutes the most effective strategy for reducing and ending their structural condition of poverty but also for guaranteeing their societal inclusion and cultural empowerment. Finally yet importantly, the effective recognition of indigenous peoples’ land rights could also be understood as a culturally sensitive approach to the realization of the UN 2030 Agenda and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere) that takes into consideration and respects their cultural diversity.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129837115"

It uniquely contributes to the growth-poverty-inequality discourse by using per capita consumption expenditure growth (poverty), Gini index (inequality) and GDP growth (economic growth). It is a comparative analysis of 58 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Latin American (LAC) countries (from 2000 to 2015) to determine whether economic growth reduces the incidence of poverty and if its interaction with income inequality enhances or alters its impact on poverty. Consistent findings from a multi-analytical approach using pooled ordinary least squares, fixed effects and system GMM reveal that: (1) economic growth exhibit poverty-reduction properties; (2) the growth rate of inequality intensifies poverty, (3) inequality aggravates the impact of growth on poverty, and (4) the growth-poverty-inequality trilemma differs across income groups and regional samples. Furthermore, this study submits that the interaction of income inequality dampens the positive impact of economic growth on the incidence of poverty and supports the argument that the extent of inequality lessens the effect of inclusiveness. Hence, income inequality is a crucial determinant of poverty.

The target of Goal 1 is to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. While income inequality and unemployment have played a major part in contributing to poor wellbeing in the world, other factors such as political instability, a lack of good investment opportunities, and living conditions have contributed to it as well. Thus, in this work, the authors analyze the factors that impact poverty and compare these results between countries within the European Union and post-communist countries that include the Western Balkan (WB) countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia. The method used consists of both descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis using the fixed effect model where poverty is taken as the dependent variable. The data used in this study are gathered from theWorld Bank and Legatum Prosperity, during the period between 2009 and 2018. The results show that income inequality does indeed impact the further progress of poverty for both the EU and WB, while economic development in terms of GDP is shown to have a more significant impact on EU than in WB, where the most significant impact was through income per capita. Other factors such as education, investment environment, and especially unemployment also significantly impacted on decreasing the poverty rate in both economic zones.","Economic Wellbeing; Eu; Fixed Effect; Income Inequality; Poverty; Western Balkan; Economic Development; Education; European Union; Gross Domestic Product; Income; Investment; Multiple Regression; Sustainable Development; Albania; Balkan; Bosnia And Herzegovina; Greece; Macedonia [greece]; Montenegro; Serbia; Turkmenistan","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092153424"

Ghana is not only a country that bears the distinctive features of the African context, but it also models the characteristics of an emerging economy where innovation is central for further progress. In that regard, the question of how knowledge and innovation can be further stimulated to enhance growth sustainably is of keen interest to stakeholders, policy makers, development actors, innovation scholars and others alike. Finding answers to this question has become quite urgent against the background of the imperatives of sustainable development. The focus on managerial knowledge transfer to build managerial capability is a major effort to understand and address some of the crucial challenges facing emerging economies with the appropriate answers. Sustainable development is a global agenda. Invariably, nations ought to strategise for the attainment of the SDGs within their socio-economic contexts and in line with their national aspirations. For a country such as Ghana, the SDGs of poverty elimination, food and nutrition security, good health and well-being are at the core of national efforts. Ghana’s poverty incidence of 24.2 per cent of the total population may be one of the examples of relatively low poverty incidence on the continent. However, it is still not acceptable that almost a quarter of the human population in a nation should be living in poverty, especially when the aim of SDG 1 is to ‘end poverty in all its forms everywhere’. The current industrialisation drive with the flagship programme of One District One Factory (1D1F) illustrates the efforts at creating conditions for economic advancement. In the process, MNEs have the potential of being major players.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139661073"

The contradictions involved in poor people, in poor locations, with poor labour rights, putting on smiling faces to serve rich guests of former colonial powers and to clean up their messes, should not be overlooked if we are genuinely interested in challenging the negative aspects of global tourism and making it more equitable and sustainable in the future. Thus, if governments and tourism industry players wish to do more than pay lip service to SDG1, they will need to make some significant changes to the way in which they work.

Moreover, they recognize that they cannot mobilize the necessary resources and capabilities for this purpose alone. Hence, they have called for cooperation from all stakeholders including multinational enterprises (MNEs) to assume responsibility and strive to contribute to the SDGs. However, since co-partnering with the state for inclusive development is outside the traditional mandate of MNEs, this chapter explores the ways in which policy can nudge MNEs to contribute to the first pillar of sustainable development, namely SDG1 to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. A two-stage methodology is applied to address the research queries. First, a conceptual framework on impact of MNE interventions on SDG1 is developed. Second, the framework is validated through a meta-analysis of the abstracts of articles selected via a scoping review of the economics and management literature. This leads to an in-depth understanding of policy design features that can nudge MNEs to make positive contributions toward poverty alleviation. Four distinct pathways foreign direct investment (FDI), public-private partnerships (PPP), corporate social responsibility (CSR), and knowledge transfer are identified for nudging MNEs toward SDG1. Nevertheless, the potential impact may not be realized due to the inappropriate strategies of the MNE, the drawbacks of the policies of the host government, and/or systemic challenges of the host country context. This chapter further explores the positive and negative impact on these pathways as a step toward exploring how MNEs can contribute to all the SDGs.","Bop; Csr; Development Policy; Fdi; Knowledge Transfer; Mne; Policy Intervention; Poverty; Ppp; Sustainable Development Goals (sdg)","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029678882"

As quite all the groups, ostracods intensively suffered of the end Palaeozoic events but they have the particularity to pass the PTB and to be present in quite all marine environments. We have studied the ostracod assemblages from the best preserved marine Permian-Triassic sections through the world. These sections are, for most of them, located along the Palaeo-Tethys margins: South China Block and Tibet (R.P. China), Bu¨kk Mountains (Hungary), Dolomites (Italy), Taurus Mountains (Turkey) and Elbourz Mountains (Iran). These areas present different environmental settings from very shallow water to deep shelf. The biostratigraphy is well constrained by the presence of conodont index. In deep environment from external shelf to slope, all the Permian ostracods disappear slightly before the PTB and are absent from the Early Triassic. The last representatives of palaeopsychrospheric forms occur in the early Anisian.On the platforms, during the Late Permian, the ostracods are abundant and highly diversified everywhere along Peri-Tethyan margins. The typical Palaeozoic forms are mixed with the very first Meso-Cenozoic representatives. The specific extinction rates, in the latest Permian, vary from 74% to 100%. During the earliest Triassic, two different settings have to be considered: with or without microbialitic deposits. The development of microbialites gives favorable ecological conditions to ostracods. During the Griesbachian, the fauna is composed of both new comers and surviving Palaeozoic forms. The reduction of size is frequently observed. This interval is called ""survival stage"". During the Dienerian and the Smithian the fauna are very scarce and poor. These two substages represent the maximum of poverty for the ostracod fauna, may be due to the development of anoxia on the platforms. During the Spathian, occurs the beginning of the true recovery. The very last Palaeozoic representatives are found in the earliest Anisian which is the radiation stage of ostracod fauna with typical new comers. The interval of Palaeozoic-Meso-Cenozoic ostracod turnover is quite long (about 15.

Neoliberalism has in part facilitated the advent of new modes of surveillance to police the “dangerous classes, "" has resulted in the “hollowing out” of the welfare state and general erosion of the social safety net, signaled the emergence of a new “enemy from within” through harsh immigration policies, and catalyzed the re-regulation of the domestic sphere in ways that privilege markets. This includes the de-regulation of food, labor, housing, and transportation policies that at least rhetorically protected groups considered to be the nation’s “deserving poor”- children, the elderly, the “disabled, "" and the willing but unemployed worker. Street-level bureaucrats’ discretion and authority in the day-to-day lives of impoverished people has increased significantly (Lipski, 1980). New welfare regulations disqualified families struggling with generational poverty from the receipt of continuous welfare benefits (Katz, 2001; Soss et al., 2011). All the while sanctions targeting single mothers and “dead-beat fathers” were used to fleece the welfare rolls and, in effect, privilege “traditional” family forms, all the while policing the reproductive behaviors, leisure, and work patterns of single-parent families that were often non-white, considered “non-traditional, "" and impoverished (Geva, 2005; Roberts, 1997). With the emergence and “glorification” of “hyper-incarceration”-the selective targeting of unskilled black workers made “redundant” by a changing political economy for criminal justice intervention-poor urban and rural denizens now live under the watchful gaze of an expanded penal state (Eason, 2012; Goffman, 20091; Wacquant, 2009 and 2010), leading sociologist Loic Wacquant to admonish scholars of punishment and poverty to “relink social welfare and penal policies” in order to “grasp the new politics of marginality” (Wacquant, 2009 and 2012a). This “new politic” is not simply the result of a “hollowed-out state, "" but of a redeployed and reconfigured one (Wacquant, 2012b), significantly expanding the reach of the state into the everyday lives of the poor. To this end, Wacquant writes: [T]he police, the courts and the prisons are, upon close examination, the somber and stern face that Leviathan turns everywhere toward the dispossessed and dishonored categories trapped in the hollows of the inferior regions of social and urban space by economic deregulation and the retrenchment schemes of social protection.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107253629"

With well over one hundred characters on the show, Simon creates a multifaceted and nuanced reflection of the intricacies that permeate the lives of local and global citizens.And while the themes of the series are complex and diverse, Simon’s approach is one that focuses on the very quotidian features of life. Each story the viewer encounters is a human story – stories of birth and loss; grief and longing; love and anger.While The Wire clearly offers structural critiques of rampant inequality in the urban ghetto, it also illuminates the psycho-social and disciplinary effects of a life in racialized poverty. And despite the series’ location in Baltimore, one could imagine the characters living in any urban city from the ghettos of Rio to the slums of Cape Town. Its transportability is reflective of the series’ capacity to lay bare, for its viewers, the effects of violence and the seeming vulnerability of those whose very existence is wrapped up in the racial, economic and gender inequalities endemic to the socalled “game.” It is this capacity to show the twin experiences of violence and vulnerability that makes The Wire an extraordinary text of political theory. For it signals to its audience3 the precarious existence of those who the liberal nation ignores and refuses to protect. At first glance, one could critically dismiss The Wire as reflective of thebanalization of violence, for violence is everywhere: from the spasmodic violence of Black on Black crime depicted in the gang war betweenAvon Barksdale’s crew and the up and coming king-pin Marlo Stanfield to the racialized police violence deployed by Officer Roland “Prez” Pryzbylewski against a young AfricanAmerican teenager at the Franklin Towers.4 In fact, one could argue that violence is the vital catalyst of the series. But it is in this violence that the series conveys the precarious existence of life on the streets. The series begins with the aftermath of the murder of a street player named SnotBoogie. This iconic scene frames the experience of violence as a banal practice of everyday life – one inherent to “the game.” The series opens with Detective Jimmy McNulty interviewing a young African American male witness while sirens blare and small children watch on. McNulty is investigating the shooting death of Omar Isaiah Betts, better known by the street name Snot Boogie. Snot has been shot for stealing the money pile from an alley craps game. As the interview continues McNulty is informed that this had been the modus operandi of Snot all along. McNulty responds to the young interviewee, “Let me understand you. Every Friday night, you and your boys shoot crap, right? And every Friday night, your pal Snot Boogie… he’d wait till there’s cash on the ground and he’d grab it and run away? You let him do that?” The young man responds to McNulty in the affirmative and then the audience is struck by perhaps the most important framing dialogue of the series. McNulty quizzically asks the man, “I gotta ask you: if every time Snot Boogie would grab the money and run away … why’d you even let him in the game?” After a stumped “what?” from the young man, McNulty asks again, why did they let Snot Boogie play? The response: “Got to. This isAmerica, man.”5 Here the series juxtaposes the language of liberal freedom against the realities of the precarious existence of those who exist on the streets.As The Wire’s creator, David Simon, so clearly shows theAmerica this series portrays is one whose population’s freedom is wrapped up with the experience of violence – a violence that is almost expected from the police and state institutions that surround it. It is telling that as the conversation ends between McNulty and the witness we see a dead and bloodied Snot Boogie lying on the street in view of all around. Kids are watching, a street cop is casually taking notes as blood pools on the ground. Snot is simply one casualty of “the game,” a way of life, where violence is endemic. This opening scene is striking because it is not striking to those who live it. The violent death of Snot Boogie is rendered commonplace and pedantic. It is the quotidian experience of Black urban existence where violence and vulnerability is the framing order of being. Violence permeates the existence of every major character in the series and it isoften the activity that moves the essential storylines forward. From the brutal death of BrandonWright in the first season6 to the torture and killing of Butchie in season 5,7 it is through violence that the characters navigate the darkness that is the urban ghetto. Violence, thus, functions as the background of the practices of everyday life. Yet, this prosaic portrayal of violence does not result in its desensitization. Instead, the brilliance of The Wire is that the extremity of violence, in its various forms and machinations, exposes the very nature of human vulnerability in the context of the modern liberal nation’s decline to protect those it deems unprotectable. In this way, the series develops in its viewers a new perspective on the ways in which vulnerability is the double of violence. By illuminating the human condition of vulnerability the series nudges its viewers to think about the politics of violence andvulnerability at local, national and international levels. It initiates a conversation about the limits of violence as both institutional mechanisms of control deployed by the state and intersubjective uses of violence used to gain power and money on the streets. And it is through the viewers’ exposure to this violence, to the undoing of the players of the “game,” that we are summoned to understand the precarity of being for many of the characters that make up the fabric of the series. This precarity8 is what Judith Butler defines as, “that politically induced condition in which certain populations suffer from failing social and economic networks of support and become differentially exposed to injury, violence, and death.”9 This chapter argues that The Wire exposes the complexity of precarity within“the game.” It asks the question, how do gender, sexuality, and race intersect such that certain lives and bodies become more vulnerable and less recognizable? This question opens us to many others: in what ways do these intersecting demands of identity and inferiority work to perpetuate a logic of urban violence? How do these intersections make the public expression of grief both unrecognizable and targets of danger? How does the state’s inability to recognize this precarity promote more interurban violence? While economics and race are no doubt essential in understanding the endemic violence in the urban ghetto illustrated by The Wire, this chapter looks to the ways in which masculinism (the privileging of masculine traits as ideal) and heteronormativity (the idealization of heterosexuality as naturalized and thus privileged) intersect with the demands of racial identity and poverty to make some lives grievable and others impossible to recognize. It examines the relationship between precarity, violence and vulnerability through an analysis of three essential characters: Omar Little, D’Angelo Barksdale andWallace. It argues that the series is a political text that exposes its audience to the precarity of being endemic to masculinist and heteronormative violence. It does so by arguing that The Wire depicts the ways in which the sociocultural demands of masculinity and heterosexuality in a racialized economic order work to (1) differentially expose some to greater violence and injury and (2) thus, produce normative barriers that limit the capacity to mourn and be recognized publicly. Paying close attention to the physical and normative forms of violence portrayedin the series, the essay argues that The Wire illuminates the ways in which the intersectional demands of gender, sexuality, race, and economic inequality foster precarious subjects who are erased from communal and political recognition. In this way, The Wire acts as a vehicle for the recognition of the precarious. It exposes the ways in which the performative demands of identity mark some as more vulnerable to violence at multiple levels, but it also offers a critique of state power that renders such identities as both criminal and erasable. Thus, The Wire is a visual text that reveals to a broader audience the precarious life of those who live on the margins. And, further, it is through this exposure of the precarity of life for some that the series acts as a political text that fosters recognition of the unrecognizable and thus helps constitute a communal politics of understanding. In order to make such an argument I turn to Judith Butler’s work on precariousness and the politics of mourning. Butler’s theoretical reflections on the relationship between vulnerability and violence help to elucidate the political consequences of the recognitionof precarity as developed by The Wire. In turn, her critique of violence as an attempt at self-constitution helps us to understand how the series articulates a critique of violence as it exposes its viewers to it in multiple and excessive ways.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086537188"

But being a Scottish woman is more difficult still because of Scotland’s position as an oppressed colony of England, and a nation with severe psychological hang-ups. There is the popular myth that the Scottish male is more domineering, his attitudes about women more ‘primitive’ than other men. Certainly, we have the same problems as women everywhere, but perhaps in more extreme form. If the myth is true, then Scottish manhood is not entirely to blame. A look at Scottish history provides some reasons for men’s behaviour: The loss of Scottish nationhood (an experience something like castration), a continuous and deliberate erosion of Scottish culture, the trauma of the Clearances, the greater levels of poverty, all these have brutalized the Scottish male, alienating him from his more natural self, from his native roots. Remove from people the sense of belonging in a particular place, deprive them of their language, their natural expression, the fabric of their traditional ways and customs, their art, their habits of thought, and you also remove a sense of responsibility to the environment, to other people. I believe the Scottish male has suffered even more from this process than the Scottish woman has. Apart from this, Scots Presbyterianism has taken an exaggeratedly mascu- line form, and been historically anti-female, blaming on the female all the sins of the flesh (witness the monstrous witch-burnings in Scotland – thousands more than in the more populous England). It has also lacked the traditionally female virtues of compassion, sympathy, sensitivity, and so on, which it has begun to aspire to in this last century. Is the Scottish dimension something every Scottish feminist must reject, turning instead to her sisters internationally and to the feminist movement? Indeed, some Scottish feminists do identify with London-based culture and fail to recognize the importance of Scottish autonomy and nationhood. As both feminist and Scottish separatist, I believe both are vital. Women have A double knot on the peeny 37 to learn to be women everywhere, but they also must relate to the environment they belong to. For Scottish women, that is a problem. Becoming a feminist is a political and psychological revolution for a woman. She achieves a new perspective on the world, as do people from Wales, Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany, or Scotland, who come to recognize the thorough-going oppression of their nations by English imperialism, which affects even the minute fabric of life and culture. Both realizations involve a radical change of consciousness, a true revolution. I do not want to see feminism imposing a khaki uniformity on women world-wide, but to see it encouraging self-liberation within a particular political and geographical context. The kind of nationalism I advocate is internationalism in a very real sense – a celebration of the differences of people everywhere, and their right to their own distinctive identity. As a Scottish woman writer, my concern is to engage in the feminist struggle within the Scottish context. My culture is under threat of extinction: Both the Scots language and Gaelic hang on by the merest thread; Scottish culture has been and still is being eroded, diluted, Anglicized. Scottish women have been silenced. All that is very much my business. Male dominated though it seems, the Scottish tradition is in many ways superior to the English ways which are gradually superseding it in many fields – in law, in education, in general philosophical outlook, as well as in more everyday aspects of life. It is tragic to see so much of worth disappearing. Being fundamentally egalitarian, the Scottish tradition is more compatible with feminism; belief in the importance of the people has been there in Scottish society for centuries. In education, for instance, the Protestant reformers decreed four centuries ago that education should be available for all, female and male, and a hundred years later had achieved much towards this end. Scottish education has always favoured a philosophical approach to studies, encouraging the individual to question presuppositions and advocating a widely-based general education, in direct opposition to the specialization favoured by English educational thinking. But little of this distinctive character remains: The Scottish system has been forced over the years to incorporate largely English ‘reforms’. Women’s contribution to the development of the Scottish tradition has been considerable, but not easily visible. Particularly in pre-Reformation days, women often held whole estates together. Within clan society, they had their own respected place. During the Clearances, when the Highland population was forcibly removed from the glens and replaced with sheep, it was not the men, but the women who offered physical resistance to the 38 In Other Words officers sent to evict them. The triumph of women during the Glasgow rent strike is well known. Writing is a claim to power. Scottish women are at one further remove from the seats of power by being first female and secondly Scottish. You can’t deal with one without the other. Scottish culture as a whole is a neglected area, lacking in status and prestige. A Scottish woman writer shares that neglect with her male colleagues, as well as being overlooked and underestimated because she is a woman. Thus, the woman writer, rare enough anywhere, is even rarer in Scotland. The Scottish woman writer must overcome the inferiority feelings stemming from her femininity, and also those stemming from her Scottishness. It’s the double knot on the peeny. It’s not easy for the Scottish woman to explore her Scottishness because knowledge of it is largely denied her in the educational system. And when she looks around for Scottish women writers of previous generations, she will seem to find very few. Looking at anthologies and literary histories, you would be forgiven for thinking that the Scottish women writer didn’t exist. Women tend to be mentioned in these volumes not for their writing, but for being the mother, mistress, wife, sister, or daughter of a male poet. The coverage of the few women (chiefly novelists) who do peek like a sunbeam through the male nimbus, is scanty and patronizing. The woman novelist seems to be more readily accepted by the male literary establishment: The novelist deals with social and emotional matters – territory to which women have established their right. And the nineteenth-century novelists Mrs Oliphant and Susan Ferrier have had their writings recorded (but not much more) in the literary histories. In the twentieth century, reasonable coverage is given to novelists like Muriel Spark, Naomi Mitchison, and Jessie Kesson, but comparing that afforded to, say, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, it is hardly adequate, and many fine novelists are ignored altogether. Scotland is not alone in this, but many women who wrote – diaries, novels, poetry – destroyed their writings prior to their death, because writing was not a seemly occupation for a lady. Many women passed their writings off as being by other people. It’s not that they didn’t write; of course they did. As early as 1700, a majority of Scottish people, men and women, could both read and write, so this is not the reason for the almost total lack of Scottish women poets prior to this century. The answer lies in the strength of the Scottish oral tradition and the tendency for it to be dismissed as an inferior branch of literature.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087264121"

International organizations like the UN have for decades made opposition to racism a central priority. And the globalized ""culture industry""-from Hollywood to Bollywood, from Disney to Globo to Benneton-has produced a continuing stream of anti-racist messages: legitimating interracial romance and friendship, stigmatizing prejudice and discrimination, and fostering the hybridization of cultures and styles. Yet as all this anti-racist policy-making, multiculturalism, and hybridization proceeds, the vast gaps between North and South, haves and have-nots, whites and ""others,"" also persist. Pick any relevant sociological indicator-life expectancy, infant mortality, literacy, access to health care, income level- And apply it in virtually any setting, global, regional, or local, and the results will be the same: The worldwide correlation of wealth and well-being with white skin and European descent, and of poverty and immiseration with dark skin and ""otherness."" Sure, there are exceptions: There are plenty of exploited white workers, plenty of white welfare mothers both urban and rural, plenty of poor whites throughout the world's North; and there are a smattering of wealth-holders ""of color"" around the world too. But these are outliers in the planetary correlation of darkness and poverty. In analyzing patterns of inequality, of stratification, it is impossible fully to distinguish the effects of race and class. These factors interact both locally and globally; they have shaped each other over historical time and continue to do so in the present. For instance, is the black worker at General Motors' plant in Ohio, or at Volkswagen's plant in the ABC region of São Paulo for that matter, so much worse off than the white worker beside him (or her) on the assembly line? Not so much. The real local discrepancies are between those who have fairly reliable, even unionized jobs, and those relegated to poverty and the informal economy.1 And then there are the global discrepancies: Auto workers' wages in the ABC, heartland of the highly developed Brazilian manufacturing economy, home base of the Confederação Unificado dos Trabalhadores (CUT- The militant Brazilian trade union confederation), and site of some of the most desirable jobs in the national economy, average about 10 percent of U.S. wages for the same work.2 Nor do we have to look at stratification to recognize the continuing significance of race. When we turn to the world political system, to the social structure of domination and subjugation, to the allocation of voice and voicelessness, the point is confirmed again. A worldwide political class exercises power from corporate boardrooms and government ministries alike: how multiracial, how committed to racial equality, is this select group? Of course at the commencement of the twenty-first century, after the end of colonialism and the conclusion of the Cold War, political rule can claim to be democratic almost everywhere. But democracy now means little more than that the citizenry ""periodically enjoys the right to withhold their acclaim,"" as Jürgen Habermas remarked (Habermas 1997; see also Habermas 1996).3 In such a system the racial gradations of power and powerlessness can sometimes be confusing, but long-standing patterns of racial hierarchy still hold. Do citizens of the core nations of the metropolitan North, do the whites of the world, exercise much political power? No, they do not. How much ""freedom"" (in the sense of the relative absence of coercion, the availability of personal autonomy) do they possess relative to the racialized ""others"" both in the northern metropoles and ""down home"" in the world's South? There are two answers. First, in a given local/national setting-in Los Angeles or Frankfurt, Fortaleza or Durban-whites experience a sense of belonging, a sense of entitlement, that blacks, immigrants, racialized ""others,"" rarely if ever enjoy. Second, on a global level, however disfranchised, however yoked to a low-skilled and inadequately paid job, however resentful of those in command, however manipulable by racists both ""old"" and ""new,"" the ordinary schmo in the world's North-in the still largely white bastions of Europe and North America and (""honorary white"") Japan-disposes of a greater basket of life chances, greater freedom, than most of his or her southern brothers and sisters could even imagine.4 Culturally too the old system rules. Whence cometh the ideals, the near universal representations, the recognizable icons and idols: where do Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson and Michael Mouse live? In Hollywood, of course (or perhaps in Orlando)! Whose names adorn the canonical bookshelves, whose artworks hang in the museums, whose films does the world stand in line to see? Yes, here again there are exceptions: There is the vast treasurehouse of black music that rules the audio world from Bensonhurst to Bahia,5 even if it is harnessed to the profit-making imperatives of global media conglomerates; there is not only Hollywood but also Bollywood; there is Chris Ofili, who scandalized New York Mayor Giuliani with his painting Black Madonna. But ""McWorld"" (Barber 1995) is still a largely northern place. To make sense of these developments and dilemmas, we must rethink the concept of racism. Just as the meaning of race has proved to be malleable and fungible, changing dramatically in the years since World War II, for example, so too the meaning of racism has changed over time. The attitudes, practices, and institutions of the epochs of colonialism, segregation, or apartheid may not have been entirely eliminated, but neither do they operate today in the same ways that they did half a century ago. Employing a similar logic, it is reasonable to question whether concepts of racism that were developed in the early postwar period, when the limitations of both nationalist revolution and moderate programs of reform had not yet been encountered, could possibly remain adequate to explain racial dynamics and conflicts in the twenty-first century. Today racism operates in societies and institutions that explicitly condemn prejudice and discrimination. In the era that succeeded the post-World War II racial break, the conflicts between anti-racist movements and reform-oriented regimes resulted in a new pattern of racial rule, one that makes concessions without surrendering fundamental power. Put somewhat differently: After half a millennium in which global power and capitalist development had been based on racial domination, opposition to the coercive rule required by this old-world racial system simply became too strong. Faced with increasingly assertive demands for democracy and national liberation-demands that sometimes reached revolutionary levels of mobilization and involved prolonged armed conflict- The world racial system underwent a transition from domination to hegemony. Segregation and colonialism- At least in their explicit, state-enforced forms-were abandoned as the principal instrumentalities of racial rule. But having conceded this much, northern rule, metropolitan rule, capitalist rule, found its stability largely restored. The new world racial system could maintain much of the stratification and inequality, much of the differential access to political power and voice, much of the preexisting cultural logic of collective representation and racial hierarchy, without recourse to comprehensive coercion or racial dictatorship. Since the political energy and support available to its movement adversaries was limited, a new era of world racial equilibrium could be proclaimed. Opposition was now effectively reduced: since the moderates had been effectively satisfied by reforms, only radical groups remained restive; they could be contained by a combination of marginalization and repression. In the age of racial hegemony, then, what forms does racism take? To the extent that the transition from domination to hegemony has been accomplished, it is racism's reinforced structural role, its ""cleaned-up,"" ""streamlined,"" and ""mainstream"" manifestations, that allow it to survive and indeed go largely politically unchallenged at the dawn of the twenty-first century. © 2010 by Rutgers, The State University.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904715959"
