Although electricity is available, particularly in urban areas, it is unreliable as it frequently experiences outages. Therefore, this study characterizes the production and consumption patterns of firewood and charcoal in the Northern part of Ethiopia, focusing on rural and urban disparities. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 276 households to analyze fuel usage, sourcing, management practices, and preferred tree species. Results reveal significant differences in fuel production and consumption between rural and urban areas, with rural households predominantly engaged in charcoal production and firewood collection, while urban households rely heavily on market purchases. On average, rural households produced 62.52 bundles of firewood and 172.98 sacks of charcoal annually, while urban households produced 43.14 bundles of firewood and did not produce charcoal. Firewood and charcoal are essential for cooking, heating, and other domestic uses, with Olea europaea, Anogeissus leiocarpa, Eucalyptus globulus, Acacia polyacantha and Acacia abyssinica being the most preferred species due to their high calorific value and availability. The study highlights the reliance on natural forests and the need for sustainable management practices to mitigate deforestation and ensure long-term energy security. Policy recommendations include promoting agroforestry, sustainable harvesting, and alternative energy sources to reduce pressure on forest resources.","Energy Consumption; Energy Sources; Fuelwood; Management Mechanisms; Rural-urban Disparities; Tenure Systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010531905"

This study examines the intricate relationship between CO2 emissions and various economic and industrial factors in Bangladesh, using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound test. By analyzing data from 1971 to 2020, the research identifies both short-run and long-run dynamics influencing CO2 emissions. The findings reveal that industrial production and non-renewable energy consumption have a significant positive impact on CO2 emissions, while agricultural activities and fertilizer consumption exhibit a negative effect. The study underscores the need for Bangladesh to transition towards renewable energy sources and improve agricultural practices to mitigate CO2 emissions. Advanced econometric techniques, including the ARDL Bound Test, CUSUM, and CUSUMSQ, are employed to ensure the robustness of the results. The ARDL framework yields key metrics: RMSE = 0.034, MSE = 0.001, AIC = -160.002, BIC = -139.651, R-squared = 0.801, and adjusted R-squared = 0.753, to explore the CO2 emissions nexus in Bangladesh. The study concludes that, while industrial and energy factors significantly contribute to CO2 emissions, enhancing renewable energy use and adopting climate-smart agricultural practices are essential for sustainable environmental management.

This article examines how policy interventions influence food affordability and supply, with a particular focus on climate change and dietary patterns. Scope & motivation: Analyzing 122 articles on the agricultural supply chain, it explores strategies to address affordability and supply challenges. Rising global temperatures threaten food stability, highlighting the importance of agricultural policies in lowering production costs and improving farmer resilience and motivation to ensure a more sustainable and secure food system. Major findings with hypothesis, methods & results: Climate change manifests diverse effects, including food security in regions less reliant on agriculture, with rainfall patterns being significant in northern and central areas. The food production process, a significant contributor to the industry's carbon emissions, exacerbates global warming. Thus, minimizing this carbon footprint is imperative for achieving sustainable development goals. The transition towards low-carbon footprint food is influencing environmental, economic, and policy dimensions. Achieving a low-carbon future in food production and consumption requires a comprehensive approach. Conclusion: Food choices significantly impact the environmental footprint of the food system, intertwining with climate change, land use, and dietary habits. Effective mitigation policies are crucial for future economic prosperity. Sustainable diets emerge as a critical global issue in the 21st century, with excess production of high-energy foods juxtaposed with insufficient output of fruits and vegetables.

This study examines the feasibility and cost implications of implementing a Healthy and Sustainable Basic Food Basket in Chile that aligns with the EAT–Lancet diet recommendations, through its comparison with the current Basic Food Basket used for the poverty line definition. Methods: The Healthy and Sustainable Basic Food Basket was constructed based on the EAT–Lancet dietary model and was uniquely adapted to reflect the observed consumption patterns of Chile’s lowest income quintile, allowing for a more realistic affordability assessment for vulnerable populations. Food prices from the National Institute of Statistics were analyzed over a 10-year period (2014–2023). Results: This study found that the Healthy and Sustainable Basic Food Basket provides 2001 kcal per day with a balanced macronutrient distribution. However, its average cost was 13.9% higher than the Basic Food Basket, posing a significant economic barrier for low-income populations. The cost gap varied seasonally, peaking in October (21.1% higher) and narrowing in December (4.6% higher). Long-term trends showed increasing costs for both baskets, with the Healthy and Sustainable Basic Food Basket reaching its highest price in 2023, further limiting affordability. Conclusions: These findings highlight the limitations of current poverty measurement frameworks in Chile, which prioritize caloric sufficiency over nutritional quality and sustainability. This suggests a need for policy revisions to incorporate the cost of healthy and sustainable diets into poverty assessments and social protection programs. Key policy recommendations include promoting healthier diets and improved food nutrition, supporting low-carbon foods, regulating local food production and supply systems, and encouraging seasonal, local consumption. This study underscores the need for structural interventions to ensure equitable access to sustainable diets, addressing both public health and environmental concerns.","Affordability; Diet; Health; Nutrition; Poverty; Public Policy; Sustainability; Article; Caloric Intake; Carbon Footprint; Chile; Climate Change; Consumer Price Index; Controlled Study; Cost; Dairy Product; Diet; Dietary Pattern; Disease Management; Environmental Sustainability; Extreme Poverty; Food Industry; Food Intake; Food Processing; Food Security; Fruit; Global Health; Grain; Greenhouse Gas Emission; Human; Lowest Income Group; Macronutrient; Malnutrition; Nutrition; Nutritional Requirement; Nutritional Value; Obesity; Overnutrition; Poverty; Poverty Level; Practice Guideline; Processed Food; Public Policy; Research Gap; Retail Outlet; Seasonal Variation; Syndemic; Vegetable; Vulnerable Population; Water Footprint; Whole Grain; Catering Service; Comparative Study; Economics; Healthy Diet; Nutrition Policy; Costs And Cost Analysis; Diet, Healthy; Food Supply; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Poverty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009254327"

Data for this study is sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), encompassing detailed records of energy production and consumption across various sources such as natural gas, renewables, nuclear power, and fossil fuels. To prepare the data for modeling, this paper implemented detrending techniques using linear regression to remove long-term trends, ensuring that the model captures short-term variability and seasonal patterns accurately. This study conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The InceptionTime model was trained on sequences of 12 months, with cross-validation employed to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting. The results indicate that the model effectively captures the underlying dynamics of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy metrics, providing reliable forecasts. The forecasts reveal a continued downward trend in CO2 emissions, suggesting the effectiveness of current emission reduction policies and clean energy investments. Conversely, total energy consumption is projected to rise, underscoring the need for strategic planning to ensure a sustainable energy supply.

Drawing on time-series data from national and local statistical yearbooks, screened and processed to ensure consistency, the research analyzes evolving rural energy consumption patterns across nine cities in Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, and Guangdong provinces. Biomass energy potential was estimated by integrating crop production and domestic waste data with region-specific residue-to-product ratios, calorific values, and conversion efficiencies. These estimates were further spatialized through GIS-based surplus–deficit modeling to reveal regional disparities in supply–demand balance. The analysis identifies a critical income threshold, whereby lower-income regions exhibit rapid growth in energy consumption until reaching a saturation point around RMB 13,000, while higher-income areas experience continued increases in energy demand beyond the capacity of biomass resources to supply. The findings emphasize that an integrated approach, incorporating agricultural residue and domestic waste utilization, is essential for facilitating sustainable energy transitions, particularly in economically advanced regions. Furthermore, the study develops a scalable framework that integrates socioeconomic and spatial variables into biomass energy planning, underscoring the need for regional transition strategies to address not only resource endowments but also demographic mobility, urbanization dynamics, and income-driven consumption behaviors.","Climate Change; Energy Consumption; Energy Transition; Local Energy; Spatial Modelling; Urban Sustainability; Profilometry; Bio-mass Energy; Domestic Wastes; Eastern China; Energy Transitions; Energy-consumption; Local Energy; Socio-economics; Spatial Analysis; Spatial Modelling; Urban Sustainability; Crops","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006849842"

The results show that SMX degradation follows a rapid kinetic pattern, achieving complete removal within 30 min. However, total organic carbon reduction occurs more gradually, indicating the persistence of organic intermediates before full mineralization into CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O. DO evolution follows a biphasic trend: an initial decline due to oxidative consumption, followed by an increase due to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> decomposition into O<inf>2</inf>. Initially, at [H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>]<inf>0</inf> ≥ 3.0 mM, DO sharply increases, while at [Fe(II)]<inf>0</inf> = 5.0 mg/L, DO reaches a minimum of 0.3 mg/L due to higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Water quality parameters such as color, turbidity, and aromaticity were also monitored. Aromaticity significantly decreases within 30 min, confirming SMX ring cleavage. Color and turbidity initially intensify and increase due to intermediate formation but later decrease as mineralization progresses. Optimal conditions (1 mol SMX: 10 mol H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>: 0.05 mol Fe(II)) ensure efficient degradation with minimal oxygen depletion without excessive scavenging effects. These findings confirm that the photo-Fenton process effectively removes SMX while improving water quality, making it a sustainable alternative for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.","Advanced Oxidation Processes; Dissolved Oxygen Dynamics; Photo-fenton Process; Sulfametoxazole Degradation; Water Treatment; Carbon Dioxide; Chemical Compound; Degradation; Dissolved Oxygen; Drug; Turbidity; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality; Water Treatment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003676536"

Since China entered a new era in 2012, the supply of agricultural and animal husbandry products in Qinghai has continuously enhanced. However, the implementation of ecological policies such as Grain for Green and Grassland Ecological Compensation restricted the cultivation and grazing areas. At the same time, with the improvement in living standards and food consumption demand of local residents, the contradiction between human beings and land has become increasingly prominent. It is necessary to analyze the balance between food supply and demand to evaluate food security. This study used supply–demand analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis based on county-level statistical data on production and consumption collected through random sampling surveys to reveal the characteristics of the production and consumption of the main food types in Qinghai during 2012–2022 as well as to analyze the food self-sufficiency changes and their spatial clustering features. The results showed that the regions with higher grain and meat production in Qinghai were concentrated in the northeast in the past decade, while the regions with higher consumption were mainly in the counties with larger populations. At the county level, grain could not achieve self-sufficiency, except in northeastern Qinghai; meat was self-sufficient in most counties. Through regional allocation, Qinghai had achieved grain and meat self-sufficiency at the provincial level. The self-sufficiency of grain and meat showed obvious clustering, with high-value clusters of grain self-sufficiency and low-value clusters of meat both distributed in the provincial capital and surrounding areas, which were related to the adjustment of urban residents’ dietary structure from staple foods to diversified foods. This study provides a scientific basis for decision makers when adjusting the agricultural and animal husbandry structure as well as the dietary structure of residents to ensure food security and the sustainable utilization of land resources.","Grain; Meat; Production And Consumption; Qinghai; Self-sufficiency; Supply And Demand","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000502773"

The crushing ratio, which essentially assesses the propensity of the sand to produce fine particles during moulding operations, is a critical property to predict the effectiveness of the mechanical reclamation process. This study assesses the crushing ratio of South African chromite sand. Five samples from the top worldwide producers were evaluated and compared. Rod milling was used to simulate mechanical reclamation. After testing, it was found that this crushing ratio varies between 1.68 and 1.93 after 9 minutes. Good statistical linear correlations were established between the crushing ratio of samples with Cr/Fe ratio, chromite content, and grain size. The investigation contributes to additional knowledge of chromite sand for foundry applications.","Chromite Sand; Responsible Production; Sand Recycling; United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; Unsdgs; Environmental Regulations; Foundries; Sustainable Development; Chromite Sand; Mechanical; Production Goals; Responsible Production; Sand Recycling; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Production; United Nation Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Unsdg; Recycling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000381552"

In the context of sustainable service management, analysis of data from 672 respondents through structural equation modeling reveals that rapport significantly affects both cognitive and emotional dimensions of customer empathy, subsequently enhancing satisfaction and long-term loyalty outcomes. This study demonstrates that emotional intelligence moderates the relationship between rapport and cognitive empathy, while service authenticity moderates rapport’s associations with both empathy components. This investigation advances sustainable service recovery theory by illuminating customer empathy formation within rapport-building processes and validating the moderating effects of emotional intelligence and service authenticity. The findings contribute to the sustainable service management literature by empirically confirming these relationships within the rapport–empathy–loyalty framework, suggesting that service providers should emphasize developing meaningful interpersonal connections to ensure sustainable customer relationships, particularly during service recovery situations. This research provides valuable insights for developing sustainable service practices that enhance both social and economic aspects of service organizations, while offering quantifiable metrics for measuring socio-emotional sustainability in service recovery contexts.

This study examines the current practices and key challenges faced by Peruvian smallholder farmers in managing a resilient, circular, and sustainable food supply chain, proposing a hybrid model that integrates ancestral agricultural knowledge with modern innovations. Methods: Using a qualitative approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 smallholder farmers from various regions of Peru. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, focusing on farmers who apply organic agricultural techniques. Data were analyzed using content analysis techniques supported by ATLAS.ti 23 software to identify patterns in practices and challenges. Results: The findings reveal that farmers operate within short supply chains, without intermediaries, applying intuitive practices aligned with circular economy principles, including Rethink, Redesign, Reduce, Replace, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle, but excluding Recovery. While social and economic dimensions are prioritized, current practices are insufficient to ensure long-term sustainability. Key challenges include technological limitations, restricted market access, and low consumer awareness. Discussion: A hybrid model is proposed, combining resource-efficient technologies with culturally rooted practices, fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration. This approach addresses identified gaps and contributes to food security, environmental sustainability, and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 1 (No Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).","Ancestral Agricultural Practices; Circular Economy; Food Loss; Food Supply Chain; Hybrid Model; Resilience; Smallholder Farmers; Sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216961310"

In this study, we compared the WF of healthy diets based on national food-based dietary guidelines with the aim of highlighting changes in dietary patterns that could reduce water requirements without compromising nutritional adequacy. Methods: Three 2000 kcal/day dietary patterns were elaborated following the Italian, Spanish, and American dietary guidelines, and their total, green, blue, and grey WFs were calculated. Results: The Italian dietary pattern showed the lowest total WF (2806 L per capita/day), with the American and Spanish patterns being 8% and 10.5% higher, respectively. The food groups contributed differently to the total WF. In the USA, animal foods were the main contributor (56% versus 41% in Spain and 38% in Italy). The contribution of plant foods was higher in Italy (61%) than in Spain (54%) and the USA (38%). The distribution of the total WF between WF<inf>green</inf>, WF<inf>blue</inf>, and WF<inf>grey</inf> was similar across the dietary patterns. Within each food group, and mainly in the animal-origin food group, the type of product significantly modulated the WF. Conclusions: Different diets can be equally nutritionally sustainable but have different impacts on environmental sustainability. The comparison of their WFs can be the starting point to promote dialogue between nutritionists, operators in the environmental sector, and the agri-food industry to ensure a healthy and balanced approach.","Dietary Guidelines For Americans; Food Choice; Food-based Dietary Guidelines; Italian Dietary Guidelines; Spanish Dietary Guidelines; Sustainability; Water Footprint; Protein; Water; Water; Fat; Oil; Protein; Water; Adult; Article; Cereal; Dairy Product; Dietary Pattern; Environmental Sustainability; Female; Fruit; Grain; Healthy Diet; Human; Italy; Male; Milk; Nutrition; Plant Tuber; Spain; Systematic Review; United States; Vegetable; Water Footprint; Diet; Dietary Reference Intake; Environmental Protection; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Value; Procedures; Water Conservation; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Conservation Of Water Resources; Diet; Diet, Healthy; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Nutritive Value; Recommended Dietary Allowances; Water","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214522335"

The agricultural sector is crucial for Colombia as it contributes to food security, the economy, and the Nation’s employment rate. However, the agricultural sector is challenged by the environment and its natural resources, especially water in water abstraction and soil in terms of degradation and land cover change. Additionally, climate change exacerbates these challenges by altering precipitation patterns, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, and further stressing water and soil resources, making sustainable management even more critical. The Resource Nexus approach comes into play to cope with and mitigate such challenges. Combined with social equity to advance the sustainability of agriculture, the Nexus approach demonstrates pathways towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger)in synergies with other SDGs, like SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). This paper addresses the dual challenge of improving natural resources management and population vulnerability reduction in the frame of environmental conflicts and population inequalities that severely affect the resilience of food systems. In line with principles of inclusion and gender equity, the methodology developed here aims to identify Colombia's productive regions that would benefit from enhanced management at the landscape level, the Resource Nexus approach. With the use of geographic information systems (GIS), this research spatially evaluates the (i) impact of land-use changes and the land-use fragmentation due to resource overuse, (ii) the provision of ecosystem services under different uses of natural resources and suggests ecosystem services planning as a methodology for municipal ecosystem-based management, (iii) climate change and the anthropogenic impacts on agricultural productivity in Colombia at the municipality scale. The results indicate significant environmental changes over the past few decades, including reduced natural forests and increased agricultural land. This shift has coincided with a decrease in freshwater availability. Additionally, there is a concerning trend of agricultural expansion into protected areas, highlighting the ongoing pressures on natural resources and the need for sustainable management practices. This study underscores the value of the science-policy interface to ensure increased social equity, economic growth, and resource conservation.","Climate Change; Ecosystem Services; Nexus; Post-conflict; Productive Landscape Management; Agricultural Sector; Colombia; Ecosystem Services; Landscape Management; Nexus; Post-conflict; Productive Landscape Management; Social Equity; Sustainable Management; Vulnerability Reductions; Fertilizers; Boundary Dispute; Climate Change; Economic Growth; Ecosystem Service; Equity; Food Production; Natural Resource; Vulnerability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213952485"

Based on the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and the third Qatari National Development Strategy (2023–2027), converting industrial solid waste in Qatar into value-added products is an important target which should be implemented to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns as set by the United Nations, in the global goal: SDG 12. Away from dumping in landfills, preserving value of waste and byproduct in Qatari industries is an ideal approach to maximize economic gain, keep clean environment, optimize sustainability and reduce carbon footprint. Upgrading existing industrial procedures and increasing recycling rate should be considered for the production of new or improved quality products. Marble mining and processing generate around 200 million tons of waste per year worldwide. Quarrying, cutting, sawing, sizing, carving and polishing marbles produce aqueous slurry, sludge, powder or dust wastes from marble materials. These wastes lead to destructive irreversible impacts on ecological systems, the environment, and public health, particularly when they are discharged arbitrarily to the environment or even dumped into the landfills. Converting waste marble powder into alternative marketable products at a lower cost or better performance compared to that for the current existing products will promote sustainable economic growth and development. Marble waste can be used in different applications such as asphalt, road construction, gypsum plaster, cement, aggregates, concrete, mortar, brick making and other building materials. Also, marble waste can be used for replacing the traditional clay, fillers and other conventional materials to manufacture of high-performance hybrid composites. The socioeconomic benefits of producing hybrid polymer composites are not only recycling marble waste but also making a cost-effective sustainable construction material with desired characteristics for green building. The unsaturated polyester is selected as polymeric matrix due to its low cost and good properties. High performance hybrid polymer composites are prepared from unsaturated polyester and then, tested for their mechanical, physical, and thermal properties. In this progress work, we have explored the challenges to produce ecofriendly tiles which are cost-effective, durable and suitable for green building. The disadvantages of marble powder-polyester composite are low modulus and insufficient rigidity, shrinkage particularly during curing, low aging resistance, less water resistance compared to metals or high-performance engineering plastics. This project is still in progress. The plan for the remaining work is to use different additives in small amount, without any significant increase in the cost, in order to overcome the challenges and disadvantages of the produced hybrid composite which can be used for manufacturing tiles. The plan could also include to make some tests, with a fixed percentage of marble powder, but testing different resins, such as vinyl-esters and epoxies. For demo testing; two model houses (prototypes) with a size of 60x60x60cm will be constructed. One will be made from the hybrid composite tiles and the second made from traditional tiles. Heat leak test will be conducted in both prototypes by measuring the difference in temperatures which is created between inside the prototype box and the outside surroundings, and the required time to reach thermal equilibrium will be recorded. The longer the time to reach the thermal equilibrium the better the thermal insulation. Reducing the heat leak in green building is one of the most effective method in decreasing the indoor required cooling energy during hot weather. This also can be applicable to the heat leaking out of buildings in a cold weather environment.","Green Building; Hybrid Composites; Marble Waste; Polyester Resin; Tiles; Anaerobic Digestion; Asphalt Concrete; Asphalt Pavements; Biosolids; Brick; Brickmaking; Concrete Aggregates; Diamond Drills; Exhaust Gases; Fly Ash; Land Fill; Mortar; Particulate Emissions; Plastic Recycling; Putty; Quarrying; Rock Bursts; Rock Drills; Shotcreting; Street Cleaning; Taxation; 'current; Cost Effective; Eco-friendly; Green Buildings; Hybrid Composites; Hybrid Polymer Composite; Low-costs; Marble Wastes; Performance; Unsaturated Polyester; Carbon Footprint","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210820758"

With the use of digital technologies like blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI), this project suggests a Water Footprint Calculation Platform that calculates and offers real-time insights regarding the water footprint of various agricultural goods. By allowing users to input product names or scan labels, the platform will deliver detailed information on the water required to produce those goods. IoT sensors and weather data will be integrated to track water consumption patterns, while Blockchain will ensure the transparency and security of data. The platform's goal is to raise awareness about the water consumption of everyday products, promote sustainable farming practices, and help optimize water use in regions facing scarcity.

The ultimate goal of Agenda 2030 is to end poverty and inequality, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy health, justice and prosperity by 2030. The global healthcare sector has gained attention as an essential component in accomplishing SDG3 which focuses on good health and wellbeing. The global tourism sector has aligned itself with SDG1 which focuses on zero poverty in all its forms everywhere. Additionally, SDG12 focuses on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, which is key to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations. This paper aims to present a model to strengthen to healthcare sector in South Africa to improve medical tourism to the region in order to achieve the SDG goals highlighted. South Africa already has a robust medical tourism sector as the private healthcare sector is able to provide cost effective solutions and shorter waiting times for specific medical procedure. South Africa's private healthcare system is world-class for medical tourism because it is supported by a thriving medical insurance market. However, the public healthcare system has not been able to benefit from the current synergies between to medical tourism and private healthcare sector. Upgrading and expanding the healthcare sector may lead to improvements and growth in both the sectors and better achievement of the SDG goals. A study was conducted in the South African Healthcare sector using mixed methods to collect data from a purposive sample while adhering to a descriptive exploratory paradigm. A comprehensive questionnaire was administered to 322 participants who worked in frontline positions at selected public healthcare facilities in South Africa. The data showed that frontline healthcare personnel experience daily struggles and challenges that limit their ability to provide high-quality of service. Based on the results of this study, this paper will present a model for improving the quality of healthcare service delivery in an effort to provide improved and expanded services to the medical tourism industry.","Challenges In Healthcare; Medical Tourism; Public Health; Service Delivery; Sustainable Development Goals","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008209737"

Technological developments have significantly reduced communication and physical barriers, making challenges more effectively addressed through global interaction. In the context of sustainable development (SD), it is important to balance environmental, economic, and social aspects for the benefit of future generations. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a comprehensive framework of 17 goals and 169 actions, which require global cooperation to achieve. However, achieving these goals by 2030 will be challenging and current progress is limited, especially in areas such as waste management. The waste crisis is a growing problem due to the increasing volume of waste. It is a complex issue with serious environmental and social consequences, requiring global coordination and integrated strategies. Overconsumption and overproduction, lack of public awareness, and socio-economic inequalities are major obstacles to achieving the SDGs. Therefore, concerted action at many levels is essential to reverse these negative trends and ensure a more sustainable future. Japan's implementation of a “zero waste” strategy, coupled with mandatory waste separation, has yielded impressive results. For example, Japan has one of the highest recycling rates in the world, with more than 80% of its waste being recycled or incinerated with energy recovery. In addition, initiatives to raise public awareness and promote international cooperation on waste management have underscored Japan's potential as a model for other nations seeking to achieve the SDGs. Given the urgent need for global cooperation and the adoption of sustainable waste management strategies, Japan's success serves as a compelling example. However, achieving the SDGs will require not only emulating successful models, but also fostering widespread changes in consumption and production patterns around the world.","Global Cooperation; Sustainable Development Goals; Waste Crisis; Green Development; Strategic Planning; Sustainable Development Goals; Waste Disposal; 'current; Communication Barriers; Environmental Economics; Future Generations; Global Cooperation; Global Interaction; Physical Barriers; Public Awareness; Technological Development; Waste Crisis; Waste Treatment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003858537"

This study developed a regionally integrated optimization and prediction agricultural model to systematically analyze the impacts of climate change on agricultural systems and their feedback mechanisms from a water-energy-food-carbon (WEFC) nexus perspective. Applied to the Pearl River Basin, the model evaluates future trends in grain yield, water use, energy consumption, and carbon emissions under various climate scenarios throughout this century. The results indicate that rising temperatures significantly reduce crop yields, particularly in the western basin, increasing the environmental footprint per unit of grain produced. However, the CO<inf>2</inf> fertilization effect substantially offsets these negative impacts. Under the SSP585 scenario, CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations rising from 599.77 ppm to 1135.21 ppm by the century’s end led to a shift in crop yield trends from negative (Z = −7.03) to positive (Z = 11.01). This also reduces water, energy, and carbon footprints by 12.82%, 10.62%, and 10.59%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical importance of adaptive management strategies, including precision irrigation, optimized fertilizer use, and climate-resilient practices, to ensure sustainable agricultural production. Despite these insights, the model has limitations. Future research should incorporate uncertainty analysis, diverse adaptation pathways, and advanced technologies such as machine learning and remote sensing to improve predictive accuracy and applicability. This study offers valuable guidance for mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change on the WEFC nexus, supporting sustainable agricultural practices and science-based policy development.","Aquacrop Model; Climate Change; Machine Learning; Nsga-ii Method; Sobol Sensitivity Analysis; Agricultural System; Aquacrop Model; Crop Yield; Machine-learning; Nsga-ii; Nsga-ii Method; Pearl River Basin; Sensitivity Analyzes; Sobol Sensitivity Analyze; Water Energy; Sensitivity Analysis; Adaptive Management; Agricultural Development; Alternative Agriculture; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Crop Yield; Energy Conservation; Machine Learning; Optimization; Prediction; Remote Sensing; Sensitivity Analysis; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Basin","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213246425"

But also, for exchange of goods and ideas among people, institutions and businesses. As current literature suggests regarding the enforcement of SDG12, Sustainable Consumption and Production in cities is supported by the promotion of circular economy (CE). There is a growing number of circular businesses, but this does not guarantee the spread of circular lifestyles in the whole society. In addition, the effects of awareness raising activities and any actions aiming to change the behavioural patterns of consumers can be limited if people cannot find sufficient offers for sustainable consumption. Therefore, in our research we aim to answer the following questions: 1. What kind of circular offers and initiatives are available which enable consumers to implement circular lifestyles in cities? 2. What kind of methodologies and forms can support engaging consumers to circular lifestyles in urban areas? In this study, we aim to enrich the knowledge base connected to encouraging CE citizenship in urban areas by providing an overview of circular offer types based on the analysis carried out in three examined cities (Bologna, Italy; Budapest, Hungary and Würzburg, Germany). Circular offers and initiatives have been examined by desk research to foster urban portfolios. 101 good examples have been collected and analysed with self-developed typology for circular lifestyle enablers. Results indicate that in the examined cities special attention is devoted on forming behavioural patterns of inhabitants. In this context, the Living Lab approach as a specific form for community engagement and awareness raising has high importance for the facilitation of circular lifestyles. Moreover, care should be taken to ensure that the important activities for a circular lifestyle and sustainable consumption, the Big Points, are considered and included within the different initiatives and offers.","Behavioural Changes; Circular Lifestyles; Living Labs; Sustainable Consumption; Urban Areas; Community Composition; Lifestyle; Sustainable Development; Urban Area; Urban Development; Urban Economy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212393441"

Concrete and mortar specimens were made with different variables, such as replacement volume of natural sand with different alternative fine aggregates, water-to-cement ratio (W/C), and sand-to-aggregate volume ratio (s/a). The concrete and mortar specimens were tested for workability, compressive strength, tensile strength, and Young’s modulus (for concrete) at 7, 28, and 90 days. The experimental results show that the compressive strength of concrete increases when natural sand is replaced with BFA, SFA, and LFS. The optimum replacement amounts are 30%, 30%, and 20% for BFA, SFA, and LFS, respectively. For RBFA, the compressive strength of concrete is increased even at 100% replacement of natural sand by RBFA. For WWF, the compressive strength of concrete increases up to a replacement of 20%.

To ensure food security and sustainability, it is essential to optimize the use of water and land resources in agriculture Numerous studies have explored this problem, focusing on cropping pattern optimization. This paper systematically reviews 162 articles on cropping pattern optimization (1996–2024), using statistical analysis to identify keywords and filter papers most relevant to agricultural resource allocation and cropping pattern optimization. Our review examines modeling characteristics, decision types, and approaches related to mathematical programming and the scope of research. Finally, a gap analysis is conducted to identify areas for further exploration. Our analysis revealed that the majority of studies were carried out in Asia. In the last decade, food security has significantly influenced optimal cropping patterns, with a trend toward the simultaneous allocation of land and water resources. Furthermore, multi-objective models are emerging in response to the need for sustainable solutions, while stochastic approaches predominate in modeling uncertainty. However, there is a need for more innovative methods to capture the inherent uncertainty of environmental parameters, particularly in the context of climate change where historical data is not reliable. The review highlights the need for integrating cropping pattern optimization with supply chain design and considering broader aspects such as international trade, seasonal uncertainty, and resource allocation. It also emphasizes the importance of incorporating diverse agricultural practices, managing agricultural waste, and aligning with farmers' preferences. By addressing these issues, the findings align with several Sustainable Development Goals, including zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, and responsible consumption and production, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, efficient resource use, and enhanced food security. Future research should focus on integrating interdisciplinary insights, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering stakeholder partnerships to develop effective, sustainable agricultural systems and a climate-resilient system under increasing environmental uncertainties.","Cropping Pattern; Food Security; Mathematical Programming; Optimization; Resource Allocation; Agricultural Practices; Cropping Patterns; Food Security; Land Resources; Optimisations; Pattern Optimization; Resources Allocation; Sustainable Resources; Uncertainty; Waters Resources","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207362334"

Due to their rarity, virgin mining of RPMs is becoming more difficult and expensive. At the same time, over 62 Mt of e-waste is created globally each year. The high concentration of gold and other RPMs in e-waste makes it an excellent source for recycling. Unfortunately, current recycling methods need to separate the different metals and the current pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes also create toxic pollutants, large amounts of wastewater and require highly corrosive substances. Here we present a new method for gold removal for the purpose of recycling, using only water and high-intensity focused ultrasound to induce material erosion through cavitation. An 11.8 MHz ultrasonic transducer is used to first image the sample to locate gold-coated pads on discarded printed circuit boards (PCBs) and subsequently to remove only the gold layer. We demonstrate that the gold removal can be controlled by the number of transmitted ultrasonic bursts and that the energy efficiency is optimal when only minute amounts of the nickel layer beneath are also removed. Removing solely the gold layer also decreases the need for further processing steps. This greener gold removal method for e-waste is therefore well aligned with, and contributing to, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.","Cavitation; Cavitation Erosion; E-waste Recycling; High-intensity Focused Ultrasound; Un Sdg 12; Urban Mining; Gold; Nickel; Water; Cavitation Corrosion; Electronic Waste; Gold; Gold Coatings; Gold Metallography; Gold Metallurgy; Hydrometallurgy; Pyrometallurgy; Ultrasonic Transducers; 'current; E-waste Recycling; E-wastes; Gold Layer; Gold Removal; High Intensity Focused Ultrasound; Recycling Methods; Technological Development; Un Sdg 12; Urban Mining; Cavitation; Gold; Nickel; Water; Article; E-waste; Electricity; Environmental Erosion; Gold Mining; Heavy Metal Removal; High Intensity Focused Ultrasound; Hyperbaric Pressure; Impedance; Recycling; Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry; Scanning Acoustic Microscopy; Surface Area; Surface Property; Sustainable Development Goal; Ultrasound; Article; Controlled Study; Digitalization; Electronics; Erosion; Mining; Ultrasound Transducer; Wastewater","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206813822"

This region is susceptible to climate change due to the presence of both drought-prone and coastal areas. It also faces the problem of increasing food-insecurity due to the recent events of crop failure consequent to natural calamities. This study examines the nexus between agricultural production and food security amidst climate change for the South Asian nations from 2000 to 2019. From the empirical investigation, using Driscoll-Kraay and Panel-Corrected Standard Error estimators, we get robust results in the presence of cross-sectional dependence and heteroskedasticity. The simultaneous equation model using 3SLS is also used for the robustness check, considering the probable endogeneity issue in the model. The findings of the study reveal that agricultural production, fertilizer consumption, and land under cereal production play a substantial and positive role in determining food security in the South Asian nations. Furthermore, the varying rainfall patterns coupled with rising temperature, as well as the increasing level of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions are found to impede food security in these nations. Additionally, non-climatic factors related to agriculture and land-use are also found to induce CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, which is a major cause of climate change. Therefore, from a policy perspective, this study suggests that to ensure long-term food security in the South Asian nations, the government should implement effective policy measures, which include the decarbonization of the agricultural sector by encouraging the use of renewable energy sources and promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices.","Agricultural Production; Climate Change; Food Security; South Asia; Agricultural Practice; Agricultural Production; Alternative Energy; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Fertilizer Application; Food Security; Land Use Change; Nature-society Relations; Sustainable Development; South Asia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164125525"

Materials and methods: Relevant information related to prospects of the approaches and techniques pertaining to the sustainable use of ethnomedicine resources for the growth of the bioeconomy were retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Springer from 1984 to 2023. All the appropriate abstracts, full-text articles and various book chapters on bioeconomy and ethnopharmacology were conferred. Result: As the population grows, so does the demand for basic necessities such as food, health, and energy resources, where insufficient resource utilization and unsustainable pattern of material consumption cause impediments to economic development. On the other hand, the bioeconomy concept leads to “the production of renewable biological resources and the conversion of these resources and waste streams into value-added products. Conclusions: In this context, major emphasis should be placed on strengthening the economy's backbone in order to ensure sustainable use of these resources and livelihood security; in other words, it can boost the bio-economy by empowering the local people in general.","Ethnomedicine; Ethnopharmacological Bioresource; Northeastern India; Socioeconomic Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Biodiversity; Cultural Diversity; Economic Aspect; Economic Development; Energy Resource; Ethnopharmacology; Genetic Variability; Genetic Variation; Health Food; Human; Humidity; Nonhuman; Review; Search Engine; Sustainable Development; Traditional Medicine; Animal; Economics; Environmental Protection; India; Medicinal Plant; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ethnopharmacology; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Plants, Medicinal; Sustainable Development","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190938780"

This is due to the fact that B is flexible enough to be utilized in a diverse range of SCM-related processes, which is the rationale behind the aforementioned remark. This category includes a wide variety of different types of employment, such as researching trends, forecasting demand, and evaluating customer behavior, to name just a few examples. With the help of this literature analysis, our goals are to categorize the predictive Big Data Analytics applications in supply chain demand forecasting, identify the research gaps, and provide some ideas for further investigation. In the tough economic environment of today, firms have used a wide array of targeted marketing tactics in order to maintain or expand their profit margin while simultaneously being one step ahead of their competitors. The usage of forecasting models is a significant component of the practice of precision marketing which aims to better comprehend and satisfy the requirements of the customers it serves. The evaluation of consumption patterns and preferences on the basis of data collected from customers and records of transactions is receiving an increasing amount of focus and attention as a result of this trend. This is done to ensure that product supply chains (SC) are managed in the most effective manner possible. The basic purpose of supply chain management, commonly known as SCM, is to exert command over the flow of products, services, and information as it goes from the locations where it was made all the way to the individuals who will ultimately buy it. The presumption that capacity, demand, and cost are all deterministic is the foundation of the great majority of research on the application of SCM to problems that occur in the real world. In point of fact, the presence of uncertainty is made worse by a variety of issues, some of which include but are not limited to varying customer demand, management of the supply chain, organizational risks, and lead times. To be more specific, demand ambiguity has a significant impact on SC performance and has far-reaching repercussions for the production scheduling, inventory planning, and transportation organization. This is because demand ambiguity makes it difficult to accurately predict future demand. In addition to this, the unpredictability of the market's demand might have a negative impact on the efficiency of SC's operations. As a direct result of this fact, demand forecasting is an essential instrument for the mitigation of chain risks.","Crop Management; Discriminant Analysis; Internet Of Things; Smart Farming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201233120"

However, the environmental impacts of production and consumption models are considerable, mainly due to the demand for large quantities of resources (fuels, chemicals) and to the environmental impacts of residues’ disposal. Due to the scarcity of resources and climate change concerns, circular economy principles based on industrial ecology concepts are emerging. In this paper, the principles of circular economy were specifically applied to the olive oil supply chain, to improve the environmental sustainability of the sector. Methods: The production chain of extra virgin olive oil was analyzed using the Life Cycle Assessment method, based on primary data from an oil farm and mill in Southern Italy. The environmental impacts were evaluated through the SimaPro software and the ReCiPe 2016 Mid-point (H) Impact Assessment Method, with reference to the functional unit of 1-L bottle of extra virgin olive oil. Some circular improvement options were investigated, comparing the impacts generated by (i) extra virgin olive oil linear production without valorization of by-products, (ii) extra virgin olive oil linear production with allocation of total impacts to co-products, and (iii) two circular production systems, incorporating improvements such as replacement of diesel with biodiesel and of electricity from the national grid with energy recovered from residues. Results and discussion: The environmental impacts of the business-as-usual production pattern were identified for possible improvements. In all phases of the production chain of organic extra virgin olive oil, the most affected impact categories were human carcinogenic toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. As expected, the major contributions to almost all the analyzed impact categories were determined by the agricultural phase (92.65%), followed by the bottling phase (7.13%) and the oil extraction phase (0.22%). The valorization of by-products was considered by widening the system boundaries to ensure the environmental sustainability by developing circular patterns that feedback waste materials to upstream steps of the same process. The environmental impacts resulted lower in almost all the impact categories, with the major benefits gained in the global warming and fossil depletion impact categories. Conclusions: The analysis proved that the reuse of pomace, prunings, and exhausted cooking oil initially considered as waste can bring benefits from an environmental point of view to the larger scale of the economy, by replacing fossil fuels, as well as to the olive oil chain itself, by providing the needed energy for production.","Biorefinery; Circular Economy; Life Cycle Assessment; Linear Production; Olive Oil; Valorization Of Organic Residues; Olive Oil; Bottles; Environmental Impact; Environmental Management; Farms; Global Warming; Olive Oil; Supply Chains; Sustainable Development; Biorefineries; Circular Economy; Environmental Sustainability; Extra-virgin Olive Oil; Life Cycle Assessment; Linear Production; Organic Residues; Production Chain; Valorisation; Valorization Of Organic Residue; Life Cycle; Biodiesel; Extra Virgin Olive Oil; Fertilizer; Olive Oil; Article; Bioenergy; Climate Change; Drug Cost; Economic Aspect; Ecotoxicity; Electricity; Environmental Impact; Environmental Sustainability; Fossil; Greenhouse Effect; Health Care Cost; Life Cycle; Marine Environment; Nonhuman; Oil Industry; Practice Guideline; Qualitative Research; Questionnaire; Recycling; Sensitivity Analysis; Soil Fertility; Solid Waste Management; Valorization; Warming; Waste Management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125650650"

This study delves into the current challenges confronting UAE methods and presents an array of future perspectives to surmount these obstacles. The challenges encompass both technological and methodological aspects. Acoustic coupling and penetration issues, stemming from attenuation effects, reflections, and refractions, hinder the consistent delivery of ultrasound energy. Cavitation control and monitoring prove challenging due to potential damage and the need for effective real-time assessment. Optimization of extraction parameters, including frequency, power, time, and temperature, requires fine-tuning to achieve maximal results. Moreover, variability influenced by diverse physical and chemical properties and heterogeneous samples demands adaptable extraction methodologies. Energy efficiency and environmental concerns further underscore the need for sustainable practices. This study reveals a promising future for UAE. Advanced transducer technologies, such as multifrequency transducers and adaptive focusing, offer enhanced precision and control. Real-time monitoring and feedback systems utilizing acoustic emission analysis and imaging techniques will ensure optimal extraction conditions. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) integration aid process optimization, data analysis, and pattern recognition. Incorporating nanoparticles, including sonosensitizers and microbubble contrast agents, amplifies cavitation effects. Green ultrasound extraction methods, which involve reduced energy consumption and nontoxic solvents, are consistent with increasing environmental awareness. Ultimately, the transformative potential of ultrasound extraction extends across industries. In medicine, pharmaceuticals, food, the environment, and cosmetics, applications are poised for advancement.

The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offers promising solutions for optimizing fish farming practices and ensuring sustainable aquaculture. This abstract provides an overview of the role of AI in fish growth and health status monitoring, emphasizing its significance in promoting a sustainable aquaculture industry. AI technologies, such as machine learning and computer vision, have shown immense potential in analyzing large volumes of data collected from fish farms. By leveraging AI algorithms, fish farmers can gain valuable insights into fish growth patterns, feeding behavior, and environmental factors affecting fish health. These algorithms can detect and predict anomalies, diseases, and stress indicators, enabling proactive interventions to mitigate health issues and reduce losses. One of the key applications of AI in aquaculture is the development of smart monitoring systems. These systems employ various sensors, cameras, and data analytics tools to continuously collect real-time data on water quality, temperature, oxygen levels, and fish behavior. AI algorithms analyze this data to identify deviations from optimal conditions and provide timely alerts to farmers, allowing them to take appropriate actions such as adjusting feeding schedules, modifying water parameters, or administering treatments as needed. Furthermore, AI-based models can assist in optimizing feed management and reducing wastage. By analyzing historical data on fish growth and feed consumption, machine learning algorithms can determine the most efficient feed formulation and feeding regimes, leading to improved growth rates and minimized environmental impact. Another significant aspect of AI in fish farming is disease detection and prevention. Through image analysis and pattern recognition, AI algorithms can identify early signs of diseases, parasites, or abnormalities in fish appearance and behavior. This enables prompt disease diagnosis and targeted treatment, reducing the need for excessive use of antibiotics and chemicals while improving fish welfare. In summary, the integration of AI techniques in fish growth and health status monitoring holds great promise for the sustainability of aquaculture. By leveraging AI's capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, fish farmers can optimize their practices, enhance productivity, reduce environmental impact, and ensure the welfare of farmed fish. However, continued research, data sharing, and collaboration between scientists, industry stakeholders, and policymakers are essential for harnessing the full potential of AI in achieving a sustainable aquaculture industry.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Fish Growth Monitoring; Health Status Monitoring; Predictive Analytics; Real Time Monitoring; Sustainable Aquaculture; Algorithm; Antibiotics; Aquaculture Production; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Economics; Environmental Factor; Environmental Impact Assessment; Fish; Food Production; Food Supplementation; Growth Rate; Growth Response; Health Monitoring; Health Status; Mitigation; Real Time; Seafood; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development; Waste Management","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173677838"

Climate change, the biggest trauma of the twenty-first century, has made humans switch towards natural consumption. In this regard, the growing phenomenon of industrialization has spurred consumers to invest more in ecological products. Consuming eco-friendly products has several benefits; however, countries are still unable to satisfy the consumer’s concern for the environment. The current study presents literature on environmental concerns, psychological well-being, willingness to pay for pro-environmental products, pro-environmental self-identity, and pro-environmental consumer behavior, which are required to ensure the consumer’s organic behavior. The research used a questionnaire-driven methodology to gather data from 379 participants. Data analysis was conducted using statistical software packages, specifically SPSS (Version: 4.1.0.0). The suitability of the measurement model was evaluated through structural equation modeling (SEM), which was performed utilizing the SmartPLS. According to the research findings, there is a positive relationship between variables in the study, and individuals with greater levels of psychological well-being are more likely to engage in behaviors that promote sustainable consumption. In order to foster more sustainable consumption patterns in society, policymakers, marketers, and educators may find these findings to be valuable insights.

A circular bioeconomy (CBE) model of resource use has been proposed to reuse of organic waste in agricultural production to enhance food security. However, despite several initiatives recently introduced towards establishing a CBE in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), minimal scientific efforts have been dedicated to understanding the association of CBE practices and food security. This study use data from 777 smallholder farm households from DRC, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and South Africa, to examine associations between three CBE practices (use of organic waste as compost, as livestock feed, and sorting waste) and household food security. Using different regression and propensity score matching models (PSM). Result reveal that using CBE practices more likely adds a 0.203 score of food insecurity access prevalence (HFIAP), 1.283 food insecurity access scale (HFIAS-score) and 0.277 for household dietary diversity score (HDDS) among households using CBE practiced groups. Associations regarding using organic waste as compost are generally positive but insignificant, while those with sorting waste are significantly and consistently negative. Thus, CBE innovations aiming to enhance household food security could prioritize organic waste valorization into livestock feed consider socio economic aspects such as access to land, access to market, education level, using mobile phone, income and city regions where interventions took place. However, prior sorting of waste is necessary to enable effective waste valorization.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001932006"

The oil with the highest total carotenoid content was evaluated for storage stability (30 °C/90 days) and thermal processing (100 and 200 °C/1–2 h). The results for changing temperature (33–67 °C), solid-liquid ratio (1:6–1:74 w/w), and agitation (132–468 rpm) were combined to evaluate the recovery of carotenoids from banana peel in extractions performed for 1 h. The highest total carotenoid concentration obtained from banana peel with 13% residual moisture was 756 µg of β-carotene/mL of oil at 50 °C with a solid-liquid ratio of 1:6 and 300 rpm agitation, resulting in a 55% recovery, which is superior to the extraction using acetone as the solvent (50%). Nutritionally, the carotenoid-rich oil can substantially increase vitamin A intake since a 13-mL serving can correspond to 63–117% of the daily intake of vitamin A for different groups. Regarding storage, no differences were observed in the fatty acid profile of the carotenoid-rich oil and the control (pure soybean oil) after 90 days (p > 0.05). The fatty acid profile also remained the same after thermal processing, regardless of temperature and exposure time, except for linolenic acid. 84% retention of total carotenoids was observed after storage. For thermal processing at 100 and 200 °C, regardless of the processing time, a 91 and 31% retention were observed, respectively. Therefore, the use of banana peel as a raw material to obtain carotenoids using soybean oil as a green solvent can add value to production chains, and it is aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 12 of the UN 2030 Agenda, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security, promote sustainable agriculture and ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, respectively.","Dwarf Cavendish Banana; Solid-liquid Extraction; Storage And Thermal Processing; Acetone; Alternative Agriculture; Carotenoid; Fatty Acid; Retinol; Solvent; Soybean","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185680109"

To ensure a sustainable food supply for the growing urban population a transformation of food production and consumption patterns is necessary. Here, options for reducing the food-related biodiversity footprint of Vienna (Austria), a high-income city in Europe were assessed regarding measures of product substitution, demand reduction through avoidance of waste and caloric overconsumption and a shift from imports to domestic production. The biodiversity footprints of 24 food consumption patterns were calculated with a life-cycle-assessment approach applying country- and primary biomass-specific factors for vertebrate species loss derived from a high-resolution global countryside species-area-relationship model that incorporates land-use intensity and spatially-explicit information on Vienna's source regions. Compared to the baseline food consumption in Vienna of 2010, diets with less animal products could reduce the footprint by 21%–43%, while waste reduction and adhering to the recommended caloric intake could reduce the footprint by 5% and 9%, respectively. Decreasing the demand for primary biomass under alternative diets could also free up domestic cropland and allow for reducing imports and relocating production from abroad to Austria. This could reduce Vienna's biodiversity footprint additionally by 5%–21%, depending on diet and demand level, due to comparatively higher yields and lower native species richness in Austria. Results further indicate that shifting towards a vegetarian diet requires the least product substitution per footprint reduction among the examined alternative diets. Substituting animal products with plant-based alternatives from area-efficient production systems located outside of biodiversity hotspots emerges as a promising strategy for Western cities to reduce their biodiversity footprint.","Biodiversity Footprint; Demand Side Measures; Species Loss; Sustainable Diets; Urban Metabolism; Animals; Food Supply; Land Use; Life Cycle; Austria; Biodiversity Footprint; Consumption Patterns; Demand Side Measure; Demand-side; Food Consumption; Product Substitutions; Species Loss; Sustainable Diet; Urban Metabolisms; Biodiversity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182793825"

Through the implementation of fiscal policies such as carbon taxes, pollution taxes, and tax incentives for eco-friendly technologies, governments can create financial disincentives for environmentally harmful activities and promote the transition to cleaner, more sustainable production and consumption patterns. These tax policies are designed to internalize the environmental costs associated with industrial activities, making businesses and consumers more accountable for their environmental footprint. Green taxes, particularly carbon taxes, target the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by making it more costly to emit carbon dioxide and other pollutants. This encourages industries to adopt more energy-efficient technologies and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. In addition, eco-taxes are applied to sectors such as waste management, water use, and resource extraction, further incentivizing sustainable practices. Tax incentives, such as credits or deductions, support the growth of renewable energy, energyefficient technologies, and innovation in sustainable industries, contributing to the achievement of long-term sustainability goals. The study also explores how green taxation supports the broader objectives of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to climate action, responsible consumption and production, and economic growth. Drawing on both international and Russian experiences, this analysis highlights how different countries implement green tax policies and evaluates their effectiveness in promoting sustainable economic growth while protecting natural resources. Case studies from leading economies illustrate the practical benefits of green taxes, such as the reduction of carbon emissions and the growth of renewable energy sectors, while also addressing challenges such as economic competitiveness and social equity. Green taxes also contribute to more efficient use of natural resources by discouraging overconsumption and waste. Taxes on single-use plastics, landfill waste, and other pollutants encourage recycling, reduce waste generation, and promote the circular economy. In the long term, this leads to less environmental degradation and greater conservation of natural resources, which are critical for sustaining future economic growth. In summary, green taxation serves as a powerful tool that not only stimulates economic restructuring towards sustainability but also generates significant environmental benefits. By adopting a well-balanced approach, governments can ensure that the transition to a greener economy is economically viable and socially equitable.","Carbon Taxes; Eco-taxes; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Economics; Green Taxation; Pollution Control; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216471571"

Rural areas have been transformed due to urbanization pressures, which leads to a change in the relationship between rural and urban spaces, blurring the boundaries between rural and urban areas. Due to the lack of a clear distinction, a new form of rural–urban relationship has emerged. The convergence and even disappearance of borders has paved the way for a rural–urban dichotomy and re-questioning the relationship between cities and nature. In the case of Istanbul, this transformation, especially since 1980, has been reshaping rural–urban relations. Thus, the present article aimed to rethink this new pattern described as “R-Urban”, a hybrid intersection as a field of experience. Design/methodology/approach: R-Urban creates an ambiguous and dynamic hybrid space where urban and rural operate within flexible and layered spatial boundaries. In the article, initially, a conceptual framework is presented based on the analysis of existing conceptual framework of rural–urban relationships, with transactional and dialectical perspectives. Secondly, fieldwork was investigated with representational tools such as mapping, photography and collages to determine the current status based on quantitative and qualitative data. Then, the rural–urban situation of Istanbul was conceptualized, with a focus on Beykoz neighborhood, a peripheral development with blurred rural and urban borders. Findings: Beykoz, as an R-Urban space, has a significant potential regenerating the relations between nature, humans and space and production to practices to ensure ecological resilience. The article demonstrated that the coexistence of different lifestyles paved the way for cultural diversity and the development of social relations. This diversity allowed innovative and sustainable practices while increasing social cooperation and solidarity in the region. Practical implications: To improve urban resilience, especially in Istanbul against future poly-crises, effective use of resources, healthy social environment, production-consumption network and symbiotic rural-urban relationships could be developed. Social implications: Strengthening the socio-cultural, economic and ecological systems could lead to dynamic interactions that would reduce vulnerabilities in rural–urban intersections that would regenerate and renew the city and reconsider adaptation capabilities. Originality/value: The present article rethinks this new pattern described as “R-Urban”, a hybrid intersection as a field of experience, highlighting the potential of these rural–urban intersections for future urban resilience and adaptation capabilities.","R-urban; Re-generating The City; Rural–urban Interface; Rural–urban Intersection","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212939969"

Additionally, the study investigated the challenges and opportunities to enhance fish production in these countries thereby enhancing food and nutrition security. The findings revealed persistent challenges such as a high prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition throughout the region. Fish production is hindered by overexploitation of fishery resources, inadequate fisheries management, susceptibility to climate-related shocks, limited investments in aquaculture, and inadequate access to input supplies such as quality fish seed and feed. Despite these obstacles, opportunities exist to promote sustainable fish production to enhance food security and nutrition. Countries endowed with extensive coastlines and inland waters exhibit significant potential for fishery development, while landlocked nations are increasingly exploring aquaculture as a viable solution.

It focuses on various regions of China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong Province (encompassing Guangzhou and Shenzhen), Sichuan Province, and the Tibet Autonomous Region, over a 15-year period (2008–2022). Employing remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, the research maps land cover and analyses its changes during the specified timeframe. The findings reveal significant regional variation in agricultural intensification, where agricultural expansion is linked to increased production and resource consumption. Local agricultural practices are shaped by climate, soil conditions, and social factors, resulting in distinct water consumption patterns that highlight water stress across agricultural areas. This underscores the need for sustainable water management, as regions with high agricultural output may face heightened water scarcity and competition for limited resources. Addressing these challenges necessitates integrated strategies that consider agricultural practices, water resource management, and environmental sustainability to preserve ecosystems, enhance water use efficiency, and ensure the availability of water for both agricultural and non-agricultural needs. The study underscores the importance of spatial analysis in agricultural planning and resource management for informed and sustainable landscape management. By utilizing a rigorous analytical framework and advanced spatial analysis techniques, this research provides insights into the complex spatial relationships between agricultural intensification, land degradation, and water resource management, thereby aiding policymakers and stakeholders in tailoring solutions to mitigate the adverse effects of agricultural intensification on land and water resources.","Agricultural Intensification; Gis; Land Degradation; Spatial Analysis; Water Resource Management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211758360"

To achieve the SDG 2030 agenda goal 12- “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,” there is an urgent need to shift towards using toxic-free agricultural inputs. Various techniques are widely adopted to control weed growth and development, but farmers mostly rely on herbicide application. Nanotechnology-enabled herbicide formulations are more sustainable and efficient in weed control than traditional sources. The nanoherbicides enable lesser application frequency and minimum quantity requirement, thereby preventing herbicide accumulation in soil and water bodies. Mainly nano-mediated biodegradable carrier-based herbicides possess properties of prolonged release, targeted inhibition, reduced mobility in soil, better adhesion to the plant surface, and retards rapid degradation of active ingredients (AIs), which increase herbicide use efficiency against weeds. Biodegradable carrier materials are cost-effective and readily available from living/non-living organisms and mineral sources, which can be an alternate source for metal/metal-oxide carrier materials. Materials like chitosan, plant derivatives, clay particles, and synthetic polymers are notable carrier materials reported for encapsulating or loading herbicide molecules. Applying nano-mediated herbicides is an innovative methodology for controlling weeds while considering environmental safety. This review focused mainly on recent advances in biodegradable carrier-based herbicide application in agriculture to mitigate the crisis in sustainable weed management. The ultimate objective of this manuscript is to serve as a source of reference material for exploring the nano-based herbicide formulations, their mobility, fate, and future perspectives.","Biodegradable; Carrier-based; Encapsulation; Herbicide; Nanotechnology; Slow-release; Sustainable; Weed","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211631262"

Nonetheless, due to its unsustainable nature, such practices pose significant threats to both the environment and society. The circular economy has emerged as a sustainable model explicitly designed to mitigate the harmful growth of emissions while simultaneously addressing environmental challenges. However, this innovative approach must contend with entrenched conventional consumption patterns. To ensure the successful implementation of the circular economy, it is essential to understand organisational behaviour from the perspective of individuals. This study specifically examines the behaviour of Vietnamese manufacturing firms, given that commercial waste, as opposed to household waste, has not been extensively investigated in the existing literature. Utilising the Theory of Planned Behaviour, the study evaluates a conceptual framework through the PLS-SEM method to assess factors such as personal attitude, environmental commitment, social pressure, and perceived behavioural control from an employee’s viewpoint, aiming to identify an organisation’s actual behaviour towards circular economy adoption. The findings indicate that personal attitude, environmental commitment, and social pressure significantly influence an organisation’s behaviour in implementing circular economy best practices. Additionally, perceived behavioural control plays a positive mediating role in the relationships among these constructs. The study demonstrates that most firms not only exhibit positive intentions through environmental commitment and attitudes but also effectively apply best practices within the circular economy framework. This confirms firms’ actual behaviour, thus bridging the intention-behaviour gap through the stakeholders’ perspective. Based on the findings, it is recommended that, in addition to enabling factors, barriers to circular economy implementation must be considered to fully understand the genuine behaviour of firms in this context.","Attitude; Circular Economy; Green Behaviour; Structural Equation Modelling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211190971"

Many studies have shown that agrarian incentives motivate farmers to increase production. Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a pivotal economic incentive implemented by the government of India to ensure minimum floor price for exclusive crops and safeguard the farmers from volatile market conditions. Among the exclusive crops, millets are highly nutritional crops that can be grown in diverse and changing climatic conditions. Millet crops are multifaceted and require less water to grow; hence, they are sustainable. The United Nations, at the desire of the Government of India, has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets to generate awareness and foster the production and consumption of millets. This research examined MSP’s impact on millet production in India from 2016 to 2023. Regression analysis and the Granger test were employed to analyze the data. Regression analysis is an important statistical tool for examining the impact of MSP on millet production. Additionally, we analyzed the state-wise millet production and correlated it with the associated production costs. Our findings indicate a direct correlation between Minimum Support Price (MSP) and production levels. Moreover, we observed that cost is crucial in choosing a crop. In conclusion, millet promotion positively affects production and influences consumption patterns. Furthermore, our study highlights the significant role of MSP in promoting and enhancing crop production. It is recommended that similar measures, including MSP, should be implemented for other essential crops such as turmeric.","Millets; Msp; Production; Special Status","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208885836"

Achieving sustainable agricultural development is challenging and requires a comprehensive response. This study focuses on Indonesia’s garlic production, employing a systems thinking approach to provide a holistic understanding of the interconnected factors influencing sustainable agricultural systems. We utilized the first two steps of the five-step systems thinking methodology—problem articulation and the formulation of dynamic hypotheses. This process involved developing a causal loop diagram (CLD) to represent the dynamic hypotheses and identifying system archetypes to determine leverage and potential intervention points. Our analysis identified three system archetypes—Drifting Goals, Fixes that Fail, and Limit to Growth—as key patterns influencing the sustainability of garlic production. The Drifting Goals archetype reveals that efforts to boost local garlic stock in Indonesia are hindered by the allocation of garlic for seeds, due to the lack of a clear distinction between garlic for consumption and seed. The Fixes that Fail archetype illustrates the long-term detrimental effects of short-term agricultural practices, such as the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The Limit to Growth archetype underscores the critical need for enhanced market access and a shift in consumer preferences to sustain garlic farming. To address these challenges, we recommend establishing clear distinctions between garlic for consumption and seed production, developing the seed industry, promoting integrated pest management, and reducing reliance on chemical inputs through environmentally friendly technology. Additionally, ensuring market and price stability is vital to maintain farmers’ interest in garlic cultivation. Therefore, the government should prioritize market penetration for local garlic and consistently enforce import restrictions to ensure the sustainability of garlic production in Indonesia.","Garlic; Indonesia; Production; Sustainability Agriculture; Systems Thinking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205345883"

The increasing demand from consumers for diversified textiles and clothing has strongly propelled the development of China’ s textile and garment industry. Meanwhile the serious issues of energy consumption environmental pollution and resource waste in the textile and garment industry are becoming increasingly prominent making it one of the industries with the highest resource waste and most waste production in China. A sustainable clothing consumption pattern for consumers is not only an objective requirement for China to achieve its “dual carbon goals but also an effective solution to the environmental problems caused by the textile and garment industry. However Chinese consumers currently face challenges in implementing sustainable clothing consumption behaviors such as low likelihood of occurrence and difficulty in implementation. Therefore conducting in-depth research on the factors influencing sustainable clothing consumption and its mechanisms can ensure more precise guidance for consumers to practice sustainable clothing consumption behaviors and promote the industry’ s sustainable development. Firstly the significant differences in the performance of Chinese residents in various types of pro-environmental behaviors were found through the analysis of literature. For example Chinese residents demonstrate good frugal behaviors in daily life while showing reluctance or willingness without implementation in sustainable consumption of clothing leading to an awkward dilemma. Given that frugal behaviors and sustainable clothing consumption behaviors both fall under the category of dynamically changing pro-environmental behaviors although they are of two different types they are interrelated and share the same motivation. Thus it is appropriate to construct a model of behavioral spillover effects. Secondly based on the behavioral spillover effects and self-perception theory a theoretical framework model was constructed including variables such as frugal behaviors sustainable clothing consumption behaviors environmental self-identity and social norms. Meanwhile relevant hypotheses and developed scales were put forward. Subsequently a questionnaire survey was conducted targeting Chinese consumers. After eliminating invalid questionnaires due to missing answers or insufficient response times a total of 351 valid samples were obtained. Finally by using SPSS software and data analysis methods such as reliability and validity analysis path analysis mediation tests and moderation tests the research hypotheses were validated. The results indicate that frugal behaviors among Chinese residents including aspects related to diet transportation and usage positively influence sustainable clothing consumption behaviors. Additionally environmental self-identity serves as a mediator in the relationship between frugal behaviors and sustainable clothing consumption behaviors. Moreover social norms play a significant moderating role in the relationships between frugal behaviors and sustainable clothing consumption behaviors as well as between frugal behaviors and environmental self-identity. This conclusion confirms the promoting effect and influencing mechanism of frugal behaviors on sustainable clothing consumption behaviors. It provides valuable insights for fostering sustainable consumption behaviors among Chinese residents and promoting the sustainable development of the clothing industry. Additionally this study introduces the behavioral spillover effects into the research of sustainable clothing consumption behaviors providing a new perspective for the study of sustainable clothing consumption and offering targeted policy suggestions to enhance consumer participation in sustainable clothing consumption behaviors.

In this context, the recycling of waste from the steel and iron-making industry for use as raw material in the construction industry is addressed in the present work. In doing so, in addition to recycling waste that might otherwise be dumped, the consumption of natural raw materials is reduced. With these aims in sight, several mortars are designed, seeking to achieve different strengths, with the partial substitution of natural components for by-products from the steel making industry. Fresh and hardened mortar properties were tested. The main use of the mortars was for structural rehabilitation works, so special attention was placed on the bond between fresh mortars and hardened substrate. Achieving dosages with high bonding strengths figured among the main challenges of this work in which very encouraging results were obtained.","Electric Arc Furnace Slag, Ladle Furnace Slag; Mechanical Properties; Mortar Design; Structural Rehabilitation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202596713"

Holistic progress hinges on development initiatives rooted in inclusivity, equality, and empowerment. Gender-responsive development recognizes the pivotal role of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, fundamental human rights that also drive economic growth and social advancement, as exemplified by SDG 5. Furthermore, the imperative for climate action necessitates reshaping production, consumption, and resource utilization patterns. As enshrined in SDG 13, addressing climate change requires integrating gender perspectives to ensure equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. The involvement of women can unlock innovative solutions, mitigate disparities, and enhance overall development sustainability. The Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) amalgamates the forces of women’s labour, and cooperative movements to underscore women’s economic empowerment as a catalyst for societal transformation. While the union advocates for labourers’ communal rights, the SEWA Cooperative Federation fosters collaborative women-led social enterprises to establish enduring livelihood opportunities. Hence, there is a need to analyse the initiatives taken by SEWA to achieve SDG 5 and SDG 13.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202414929"

Although estimates suggest that the current production system can provide enough food and nutrients for everyone, equitable distribution remains challenging. Understanding global nutrient distribution is vital for addressing disparities and creating effective solutions for the present and future. This study analyzes global nutrient supply changes to address inadequacies in certain populations using the existing DELTA Model®, which uses aggregates of global food production to estimate nutrient adequacy. By examining the 2020 global food commodity and nutrient distribution, we project future food production in 2050 needs to ensure global adequate nutrition. Our findings reveal that while some nutrients appear to be adequately supplied on a global scale, many countries face national insufficiencies (% supply below the population reference intake) in essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins A, B12, B2, potassium, and iron. Closing these gaps will require significant increases in nutrient supply. For example, despite global protein supply surpassing basic needs for the 2050 population, significant shortages persist in many countries due to distribution variations. A 1% increase in global protein supply, specifically targeting countries with insufficiencies, could address the observed 2020 gaps. However, without consumption pattern changes, a 26% increase in global protein production is required by 2050 due to population growth. In this study, a methodology was developed, applying multi-decade linear convergence to sufficiency values at the country level. This approach facilitates a more realistic assessment of future needs within global food system models, such as the DELTA Model®, transitioning from idealized production scenarios to realistic projections. In summary, our study emphasizes understanding global nutrient distribution and adjusting minimum global nutrient supply targets to tackle country-level inequality. Incorporating these insights into global food balance models can improve projections and guide policy decisions for sustainable, healthy diets worldwide.","Inequality; Mathematical Modeling; Micronutrients; Nutrient Adequacy; Sustainability; Systems Modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201931374"

The production of Particleboard is a good example of industry that uses high quantities of recycled wood. However, it poses risks since wood often have contaminants that compromise compliance of safety standards. Thus, it is necessary to develop methodologies for rapid analysis of chemical contaminants in wood wastes that allow easy detection of these elements. In this work, the capability of Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to detect a set of heavy metals in wood samples was explored. Some advantages of this technique, such as portability, minimal to no sample preparation, and quick analysis are characteristics that make this method one of the most suitable for this purpose of analysis. In the majority of cases, the contamination comes from the pigments used in paints, varnishes, or coatings. Titanium (Ti) e.g. is a common element in white pigments and Chromium (Cr) in red and green pigments. To ensure the presence or absence of Cr and Ti, a set of 3 lines was analysed. The results revealed the presence of these elements and that 30% of the samples seem to be highly contaminated.

As a result, more than 80% of countries in the world face different forms of malnutrition, while the environment faces further degradation due to unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Understanding food environments in diverse settings via a global lens is critical for facilitating the global transition to sustainable and healthy food environments. A virtual workshop was held with stakeholders from five nations (Germany, Ghana, Malaysia, South Africa, and Tanzania) representing varying levels of development to interrogate global food environment concerns and propose cross cutting thematic areas that may be explored and addressed through policy change and intervention. The workshop initiated a transdisciplinary project to shape food environments for sustainable and healthy diets. The Reference Manual for Convenors of Food Systems Summit Dialogues for United Nations Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) (United Nations, 2020) was used as guidance to ensure that an inclusive mix of stakeholders were invited. The stakeholders included key players from public and private sectors in disciplines of agriculture, agro-forestry, environment and ecology, education, food retail and market, trade and commerce, health care and nutrition. Following the workshop discussion, the findings were analyzed using a general inductive approach. Through triangulation of findings, we identified the common challenges and opportunities for achieving collective nutritional, social and environmental sustainability in the modern food environments, which have become more universal globally. It is evident that research and data are essential for sustainable development of food systems, while Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 – Partnership for the Goals - should be placed at the core of the transformative process. We proposed several research-driven transdisciplinary interventions to facilitate a paradigm shift from the profit logic model over everything else, and to counter the existing policy fragmentation and systemic challenges to making food environments nutrition-sensitive and socially and environmentally sustainable.","Environmental Sustainability; Global Food Environments; Nutrition Security; Participatory Approach; Partnership For The Goal; Sustainable Development Goals; Transdisciplinary Research","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198424207"

Despite several environmental and animal welfare benefits, the economic sustainability of such an approach depends on the level of consumer acceptance and willingness to pay for insect-fed poultry diets. Using the results of an online survey of more than 850 Italian consumers, we first examine the main differences between two groups of consumers: those who are willing to buy insect-fed poultry meat and eggs and those who are not. The t-test is used to search for statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of their stated preferences for key food attributes that influence purchase decisions, as well as their view on food safety, quality and environmental issues. We then use ordered logit regression to estimate the determinants of consumers’ willingness to pay a price premium for insect-fed poultry compared to conventional poultry products. Particular attention is paid to the possible role of trust in the ability of the food system to provide safe food in influencing consumers’ preferences. The results show that consumers who are willing to buy insect-fed meat and eggs are more environmentally aware, have a stronger belief in the crucial role that changes in current food consumption patterns can play for the environment and social well-being, and have a higher level of trust in the system that guarantees food safety. The willingness to pay a price premium for insect-fed poultry food is mainly influenced by respondents’ beliefs about insect-fed poultry food, especially in terms of its expected quality characteristics and animal welfare. Findings from this analysis could provide insights into investments to ensure the economic sustainability of a more circular supply chain.","Alternative Protein Feed; Circular Economy; Food Neophobia; Novel Food; Sustainable Consumption","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192975807"

This is compounded by the challenges posed by climate change and limited resources, as well as inadequate management practices. The concept of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus management recognizes the interdependencies among various resources, such as water, food, and energy, in order to promote sustainable resource management. By establishing a harmonious balance among different objectives, this approach aims to safeguard the well-being of both human societies and the environment, ensuring the fulfillment of needs and the preservation of benefits for both parties. Methods: In this study, the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus approach is applied to the Sistan plain, located in the southeastern region of Iran, to effectively redistribute production resources within the agricultural sector. The methodology employed is multi-objective programming, which incorporates various goals. These objectives encompass maximizing farmer revenue and energy derived from food production (measured in calories), while simultaneously minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, irrigation water consumption, and overall energy consumption throughout the 2018–2019 crop year. Results: The findings of this study demonstrate that implementing the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus approach in the Sistan plain yields positive outcomes. Despite a reduction in the cultivation area, there is a notable shift towards growing more nutritious crops. This shift not only contributes to food security but also increases crop calorie production from 457.16 million to 565.19 million. Consequently, there is a decrease in irrigation water consumption from 261.62 million to 260.48 million cubic meters, energy consumption from 1400.13 million to 1396.81 million MJ per hectare, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 0.014 million to 0.0139 million tons per hectare. Discussion: Analyzing the physical and economic productivity reveals that GHG emissions had the highest productivity in terms of both physical and economic measures in Zahak County. As the WEF nexus approach aims to preserve and prevent environmental degradation, it is recommended to implement development and bio-balance policies utilizing this approach to ensure environmental conservation.","Cropping Pattern; Multi-objective Programming; Production Resources Optimization; Sistan Plain; Sistan Plain Cropping Pattern","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186924821"

Uttarakhand has a total of 103882 ha of wetland area, which is 1.94% of the total geographical area. It comprises a total of 118 lakes which are located at high altitudes and cover 231 ha area. The Asan Conservation Reserve is the only Ramsar site in Uttarakhand. The presented study is an attempt to assess the ecological status of Asan Conservation Reserve, a wetland and recently declared Ramsar site in district Dehradun of Uttarakhand. The study has been carried out with the objective of determining the status of different ecological components of the Asan wetland. The study includes both primary and secondary sources of data, such as field and laboratory analysis, questionnaire method and plant biodiversity study. After meticulous analysis, a manuscript was prepared, integrating the results of water quality analysis and social and plant diversity. The study found that all the parameters of water quality were under designated criteria for use. The pH value was recorded from 7.45-8.63 with an average of 8.1. A large spatial variation was found in turbidity, which was between 1.91-7.53, with an average of 4.43 NTU. The spatial variation in alkalinity has been found in the range of 6-8 mg/L, with an average mean of 25 mg/L. The concentration of chloride varied from 79.9-199.9 mg/L. Hardness ranges from 80-128 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen level recorded was 7.9 mg/L; according to CPCB's designated best use criteria, it is found fit for class D. Average concentration of hydrogen sulphide was 4.75 mg/L, reported from the study site. Industrial processes are a major cause of hydrogen sulphide. Wood pulp, tannin, dye, wood production, etc., are the areas where it is used. Asan river covers a long journey and industrial effluent is discharged into it. These could be the possible source of increased sulphide in the reservoir. Presences of fecal coliform were found, which makes water unfit for direct human consumption. Aquatic and terrestrial weeds are the threat of concern. Growth of invasive weeds, like waterlily, Tora plants, Lantana, etc., were recorded from the study site. Visual observation and recording of plants around the wetland were done during the field study. Socio-economic analysis was conducted to determine the utilization pattern and dependency of people on wetlands. What we got through it is that the Asan wetland is a major source of fodder for livestock and weeds; trees around the reservoir are a source of fodder. Secondly, water is used for irrigation by using an electrical motor. Direct employment generation from the resource is quite low. The survey revealed that the avian population decreased in the last two years. This is further examined by secondary sources and we found that in 2020, the least number of birds visited Asan. However, the study is not able to give an accurate answer to the question of what is the dominant factor that leads to the decline in the population of birds. Identified potential threats gradually deteriorating the quality of Asan are organic debris, alongwith polythene, which causes trouble for the health of water birds, unsustainable tourism, encroachment and increasing human demand and the growth of invasive weeds. Many wetlands in Uttarakhand are facing ignorance. They are small in size, but their ecological significance is invaluable. The distribution of funds should be more strategic. Recognition and development of such wetlands would also lead to the sustainable development of rural villages. State-level efforts are needed on priority basis for conservation of such resources.","Asan Conservation Reserve; Biodiversity; Ecological Status; Physico-chemical Analysis; Wetland","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003658832"

Wastage of food is a matter of concern because it is harmful to the environment and at the same time it poses a threat to sustainability goals. Food waste (FW) generation needs to be mitigated through waste-to-energy technologies to ensure food security, reduce economic loss, reduce resource depletion, and conserve energy. This study presents the quantification of FW on the campus of an educational institute in northeastern India. Eight kitchens are surveyed to assess the pattern and type of FW generation over a year. The quantification, segregation of waste into various subgroups, and characterization are performed to give a fair idea of each kitchen’s contribution to the net food waste generation on an educational institute’s campus. Also, the probable parameters such as the number of people eating, the taste of food, refrigeration, and miscalculated estimation by the kitchen runners that affect FW generation are identified. This study also estimates the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in each of the kitchens while preparing food. Besides, the recoverable energy potential of the food waste is also explored in the study, indicating the possible amount of energy that could be extracted from the food waste based on its characteristics.

To bridge these gaps, this study estimated the arable land demand and associated pressures, considering food consumption patterns and the land footprint across 31 provincial districts in China. The findings reveal that grains remain the primary crop consumed by Chinese residents. Notably, the food consumption pattern exhibits substantial disparities among provincial districts, particularly concerning livestock products. Given China's vast population and escalating consumption of livestock, the country demonstrates heightened land demands. While China does not face a national-level food security threat, regional disparities are evident, with eight provincial districts facing potential food security risks. This study explored the challenges and pathways in maintaining food security and the visions to achieve it, emphasizing the importance of sustaining a balanced food consumption pattern, reducing food waste, improving environmentally friendly agriculture practices, formulating effective and continuous laws and regulations, and exploring potential land resource development to alleviate the pressure on arable land and ensure food security.","Arable Land; Food Consumption; Food Production; Food Security; Land Demand","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178384091"

An increasing world population, the rigidity of traditional production and consumption patterns, the complexity of economic activities, globalization, and harmful emissions intensify environmental pressures. In this context, the evaluation of various environmental policy instruments is important to alleviate environmental pressures and, thus, combat climate change. This study aims to investigate the impact of environmental taxes, renewable energy consumption, and environmental technology on the ecological footprint in OECD countries by using data from 1994 to 2018 and modern panel data techniques. The results of the AMG estimator indicate that environmental taxation and renewable energy consumption play a role in reducing the ecological footprint; however, results imply that environmental technology does not have a statistically significant effect on the ecological footprint. In addition, we applied DCCE and CS-ARDL estimators to obtain robustness results and observed that the findings remained valid. Therefore, the results of the study suggest that regulations to increase the effectiveness of environmental taxes, renewable energy consumption, and environmental technology should be promoted to ensure environmental sustainability.","Amg; Cs-ardl; Dcce; Ecological Footprint; Environmental Taxes; Oecd; Renewable Energy; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Economics; Energy Utilization; Environmental Regulations; Sustainable Development; Taxation; Amg; Cs-ardl; Dcce; Ecological Footprint; Environmental Pressures; Environmental Sustainability; Environmental Taxes; Oecd; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Consumption; Environmental Technology; Alternative Energy; Climate Change; Ecological Footprint; Environmental Tax; Sustainability; Article; Controlled Study; Data Analysis; Environmental Sustainability; Human; Organisation For Economic Co-operation And Development; Renewable Energy; Tax; Economic Development; International Cooperation; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Internationality; Renewable Energy; Taxes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169071603"

Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the integrated effects of meteorological factors, soil water content (SWC), evapotranspiration (ET), and leaf area index (LAI) on the NPP in agricultural systems remains unclear. Elucidating the evolution pattern of NPP in agricultural system and its responding mechanism to meteorological factors, SWC, ET, and LAI hold pronounced significant for sustainable agricultural operation, agroecological maintenance, and climate-adaptive strategy optimization. This study focused on the winter wheat - summer maize rotation, a predominant agricultural system, in the North China Plain (NCP). Spatiotemporal pattern of NPP was clarified using geostatistical technique, Mann-Kendall test, Sen's Slope, and Rescaled Range analysis. The mechanism underlying the integrated response of NPP to different meteorological factors, SWC, ET, and LAI was revealed through spatiotemporal coupling correlation analysis, Random Forest, and Structural Equation Modeling. The results demonstrated a widespread annual increase in NPP across the majority of rotation areas from 2000 to 2019, with a prominent geospatial heterogeneity. Meteorological factors, SWC, ET, and LAI collectively explained 70.27% of NPP variability. Of which, ET, FAPAR, P, LAI, Tmax, Tmin, and the SWC in 40–100 cm were predominant factors affecting NPP, explaining 63.59% of its variability. These factors exerted multidimensional effects on NPP, instead of a unilateral induction. Despite the limited direct effect, precipitation indirectly improved NPP by significantly increasing the SWC in 40–100 cm soil horizon. The latter not only directly enhanced NPP, but also indirectly promoted NPP by facilitating ET. In context of drought and water deficit, maintaining adequate soil moisture in the 40–100 cm layer through irrigation emerges as a potential strategy to ensure sustainable productivity. ET exerted the greatest comprehensive effect and the largest direct promotion on NPP. LAI, FAPAR, and SWC induced NPP variation indirectly through affecting ET. These consistently underscored the major relationship between productivity and water use. Future intensive agriculture in the NCP should prioritize the trade-off between carbon sequestration and water loss at plant physiological level. Improving the carbon sequestration per unit of water consumption through optimizing the photosynthesis-transpiration mechanism is an imperative climate-adaptative pathway for achieving sustainable food provision and mitigating water crisis.","Edaphic Moisture; Evapotranspiration; Leaf Area Index; Meteorological Factors; Net Primary Productivity; Winter Wheat-summer Maize Rotation; Carbon Sequestration; Crop Rotation; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Intensive Agriculture; Leaf Area Index; Meteorological Hazard; Net Primary Production; Organic Matter; Soil Moisture; Soil Water; Water Content; Wheat; China; North China Plain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166355732"

The need to ensure food safety includes, other than microbiological hazards, concerns with antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. The emergence of resistant bacteria in the food industry is essentially due to the abusive, and sometimes incorrect, administration of antimicrobials. Although not allowed in Europe, antimicrobials are often administered to promote animal growth. Each time antimicrobials are used, a selective pressure is applied to AMR bacteria. Moreover, AMR genes can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of meat-harbouring-resistant bacteria, which highlights the One Health dimension of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, the appropriate use of antimicrobials to ensure efficacy and the best possible outcome for the treatment of infections is regulated through the recommendations of antimicrobial stewardship. The present manuscript aims to give the current state of the art about the transmission of AMR bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., along with other ESKAPE bacteria, from animals to humans through the consumption of meat and meat products, with emphasis on pork meat and pork meat products, which are considered the most consumed worldwide.","Antimicrobial Resistance; Farm-to-fork Transmission; Food Safety; Multidrug-resistant Bacteria; One Health","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175068613"

So, the study assessed the toxic metals (Pb, Cd, and Cr) exposure, characteristics, and human health risk regarding the soil-vegetable system of two distinct locations in Bangladesh using atomic absorption spectrometry. The average concentration of metals in soil and fertilizer/pesticide samples followed the same order (Cr > Pb > Cd), but for vegetable samples, the order was Pb > Cr > Cd, with some extra Pb compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) allowable limit (0.3 mg/kg). Low levels of pollution with negligible ecological concerns were predicted for both locations by the soil quality indexing. But industrial influence boosted the Pb content in location B, and common sources (fertilizer/pesticide) for both locations might be responsible for a moderate level of Cd. The toxic metals transferred to vegetables followed the trend of Cd > Pb > Cr. However, the human health risks arising from harmful metals exposure at both locations were ineffective (< 1) in evaluating noncarcinogenic risk patterns through the target hazard quotient (THQ), total THQ, and hazard index (HI). Again, considering probable carcinogenic risk patterns, vegetable consumption with studied exposure levels of toxic metals followed within the acceptable range (between 1.0E-04 and 1.0E-06). Overall, location B is slightly more vulnerable than location A by considering metal exposure, pollution distribution, and risk evaluation in the study area (significant at p < 0.05). So, systematic monitoring and protective measures are required to ensure food safety and sustainable vegetable production.","Health Risk Assessment; Industrial Area; Nonindustrial Area; Quality Indexes; Soil-vegetable System; Toxic Heavy Metals; Cadmium; Chromium; Lead; Cadmium; Fertilizers; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Pesticides; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Cadmium; Carcinogen; Chromium; Fertilizer; Heavy Metal; Lead; Pesticide; Article; Atomic Absorption Spectrometry; Bangladesh; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Risk; Estimated Daily Intake; Food Safety; Geographic Distribution; Health Hazard; Human; Pollution Transport; Soil Pollution; Soil Quality; Sustainable Development; Trend Study; World Health Organization; Chemistry; China; Procedures; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutant; Vegetable; Cadmium; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Humans; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Pesticides; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Vegetables","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146256979"

Since then, various international events have been held promoting sustainability as a significant component of food production, nutrition, and human health. These events have enhanced the knowledge transition and awareness between the scientific community and policymakers concerning the importance of SDs. In this aspect, this is the first study that aims to identify trends and turning points over time concerning the research on SDs.

The documents were screened following the PRISMA guidelines, and bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Bibliometrix R-package and VOSviewer and the detection of Sustainable Development Goals with the text2sdg R-package. Overall, there was an exponential growth in the literature on SDs that followed international events from 2009 onward. Among the most impactful journals were Sustainability, Nutrients, and Frontiers in Nutrition. The leading countries in research were pointed out, as well as the high rate of collaborations and partnerships between them. The research interest was mainly focused on (a) climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental impact; (b) food systems, security, and consumption; and (c) health, Mediterranean Diet (MD), and dietary guidelines. The significance of these keywords changed over time, following the evolution of SDs concepts from the planetary environmental impact of food production to the healthier dietary habits of individuals. Among several dietary patterns, MD was identified as the most popular among the local SDs, with synergies among scientists in the Mediterranean region.

Despite the immense potential for plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) to reduce biotic and abiotic stressors, very few PGPB have been effectively registered as biofertilizers in the commercial sector. The biofertilizer market share includes a tiny fraction of the synthetic agrochemical market share. Specific obstacles hamper field-level applications of PGPB that were effective in laboratories. The preparation of formulations faces numerous difficulties, including issues with shelf life, viability upkeep, biofilm formation, and risks to human health. Different regions have different weather patterns and soil compositions. The full image of microbial interactions is still largely unknown.

The concept of biowaste refineries as a feasible alternative to petroleum refineries has gained popularity. Biowaste has become an important raw material source for developing bioproducts and biofuels. Therefore, effective environmental biowaste management systems for the production of bioproducts and biofuels are crucial and can be employed as pillars of a circular economy. Bioplastics, typically plastics manufactured from bio-based polymers, stand to contribute to more sustainable commercial plastic life cycles as part of a circular economy in which virgin polymers are made from renewable or recycled raw materials. Various frameworks and strategies are utilized to model and illustrate additional patterns in fossil fuel and bioplastic feedstock prices for various governments' long-term policies. This review paper highlights the harmful impacts of fossil-based plastic on the environment and human health, as well as the mass need for eco-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable bioplastics. Utilizing new types of bioplastics derived from renewable resources (e.g., biowastes, agricultural wastes, or microalgae) and choosing the appropriate end-of-life option (e.g., anaerobic digestion) may be the right direction to ensure the sustainability of bioplastic production. Clear regulation and financial incentives are still required to scale from niche polymers to large-scale bioplastic market applications with a truly sustainable impact.","Bioeconomy; Biofuel; Bioplastic; Biowaste; Life Cycle Assessment","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151517057"

[Objective] In recent years, the global economic industry structure and energy supply structure have transformed to green and low-carbon with the accelerated development of new energy industry. Understanding the development status and trend of the global lithium resource industry chain under the background of new energy would help us provide basic insights for the sustainable development of the global lithium industry and relevant references for the government and enterprises to improve the competitiveness of the lithium resource industry chain. [Methods] This paper reviews the specific impact of the increasing demand for new energy on the global lithium resource industry chain in terms of resource supply and demand, smelting and processing, end consumption, and recycling. [Results] Under the background of new energy, the global terminal consumption of lithium resources, especially in the field of power battery, has continued to flourish; the global demand for lithium has grown rapidly, while the price has continued to rise under the misplacement of supply and demand. With the rising importantance of lithium resources in the world, major economies have listed it as a key mineral, which conducting a series of policies to ensure the safe supply of lithium resources in their own countries, strengthen the recycling of lithium resources, and promote the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure. The production mode, structure and development goal of the enterprises are developing in the direction of low-carbon, integration and sustainability. [Conclusions] Developing efficient and clean energy has become an effective way to solve energy and environmental problems, and transportation electrification and energy storage make the global demand for lithium resources continue to increase rapidly. These changes have obvious impact not only on the supply pattern of lithium resources in the upstream, but also on the production and processing in the midstream and consumption structure in the downstream end of the industrial chain. However, the transmission and specific impact on every link of the industrial chain are uneven.","Lithium Resources; Mineral Exploration Engineering; New Energy Background; Structural Transformation; Whole Industry Chain; Global Economy; Industrial Development; Industrial Structure; Lithium; Mineral Exploration","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161060786"

With population growth in recent years, the contradiction between human beings and land resources has become increasingly prominent, leading to increased food security risks. Since 2000, the local government has implemented a series of ecological projects to guide farmers and herdsmen to transform from extensive production to intensive production, which has optimized the pattern of food production and consumption. It is necessary to study the balance between food supply and demand to evaluate food self-sufficiency. Here, we used the panel data from 2000 to 2020 collected based on random sampling surveys to reveal the characteristics of food production and consumption, the changes in food self-sufficiency rate and the dependence of food consumption on local production in Ordos. The results showed that food production and consumption dominated by grains have been increasing. The residents’ diets were characterized by excessive consumption of grains and meat, and insufficient consumption of vegetables, fruits, and dairy foods. On the whole, the locality has achieved self-sufficiency, because the food supply exceeded the demand during the two decades. However, the self-sufficiency of different food types varied greatly, as some foods, such as wheat, rice, pork, poultry, and eggs, have not been self-sufficient. Due to the increased and diversified food demand of residents, food consumption became less dependent on local production and more dependent on food imported from the central and eastern China, which threatened local food security. The study can provide a scientific basis for decision-makers for the structural adjustment of agricultural and animal husbandry and the structural adjustment of food consumption, to ensure food security and sustainable utilization of land resources.","Food Production And Consumption; Food Self-sufficiency; Local Dependence; Ordos; Supply And Demand","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149715782"

Countries around the world put food security on their high-priority political agenda. As the largest developing country in the world, China uses only 9% of the world's land, contributing to 25% of the world's food and feeding one-fifth of the population. However, with the transformation and upgrading of the dietary structure, food security in China is latent with a structural crisis. This study explored the demand for cultivated land resources under the evolution of Chinese dietary patterns, examined the transition of agricultural planting structure in China, and put forward land use strategies to ensure food security. Results show that from 1987 to 2020, the Chinese gradually shifted to land-intensive food consumption. Specifically, plant-based food, such as cereals and vegetables, gradually decreased, whereas animal-based food (land-intensive), such as meat, eggs, and milk, continued to increase. The cultivated land requirements for food (LRF) progressively approached the upper limit of domestic cultivated land resources. Unfortunately, the LRF for meat consumption was equal to that for cereals consumption, and meat consumption alone contributed 70.6% to the increase in the total LRF. More importantly, the coexistence of supply shortage and excess in China's agricultural planting structure exhibited an imbalance. Grain was trapped in a vicious cycle of more production, more import, and more inventory, but the planting area for soybean and succulence was only one-fourth of the feed grain required for animal-based food such as meat, eggs, and milk. Furthermore, this study predicted that China would be difficult to feed its population by 2050 if it relied on domestic cultivated land alone, including implementing the Chinese Food Guide Pagoda (2022). Therefore, the work suggests that it is necessary to promote the transformation of food production in China from a single supply pattern from cultivated land resources to a multi-supply pattern that relies on different types of land resources (e.g., woodlands, grasslands, and lakes). Meanwhile, it is essential to adjust the current dietary guidelines and encourages residents to adopt resource-saving diet patterns.","China; Dietary Patterns; Food Security; Land Requirements For Food; Land Use Strategies; Developing World; Diet; Food Consumption; Food Security; Land Use; Sustainable Development; China","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144812559"

In this scenario, the production of biochar from different biomasses results in environmental and economic advantages. In this study, biochar was produced from sugarcane bagasse pyrolysis, to immobilize biomolecules, in order to assemble an electrochemical immunosensor to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. For this, screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) were modified with a dispersion of biochar and used to immobilize the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) against virus S-protein, through EDC/NHS crosslinking reaction. Under the best set of experimental conditions, negative and positive serum samples responses distinguished based on a cutoff value of 82.3 %, at a 95 % confidence level. The immunosensor showed selective behavior to antibodies against yellow fever and its performance was stable up to 7 days of storage. Therefore, biochar yielded from sugarcane bagasse is an ecofriendly material that can be used as a platform to immobilize biomolecules for construction of electrochemical biosensors.","Biochar; Biomolecules Immobilization; Electrochemical Immunosensor; Sars-cov-2; Sustainability; Charcoal; Potassium Ferricyanide; Cellulose; Antibodies; Biochar; Cellulose; Alpha 300r; Pgstat128n; Quanta 450; Vertex 70; Antibodies; Climate Change; Crosslinking; Electrodes; Immunosensors; Sustainable Development; Waste Management; Biochar; Biomolecules Immobilization; Consumption Patterns; Electrochemical Immunosensors; Key Feature; Management Is; Production Patterns; Sugar-cane Bagasse; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Production; Coronavirus; Charcoal; N Hydroxysulfosuccinimide Sodium Salt; Potassium Ferricyanide; Unclassified Drug; Antibody; Cellulose; Biochar; Covid-19; Crop Residue; Electrochemical Method; Electrode; Sensor; Serum; Sugar Cane; Article; Biomass; Centrifugation; Chromatography; Controlled Study; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Cyclic Voltammetry; Electrochemical Analysis; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Hydrogen Bond; Immobilization; Incubation Time; Lateral Flow Immunochromatography; Nonhuman; Particle Size; Pyrolysis; Raman Spectrometry; Receptor Binding; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Structure Analysis; Sugarcane; Waste Management; Yellow Fever; Genetic Procedures; Immunoassay; Procedures; Biosensing Techniques; Cellulose; Electrochemical Techniques; Immunoassay; Saccharum; Sars-cov-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141753533"

The SDG12 indicators are either vague or too focused on incremental improvements in production and consumption systems, overlooking politically contested issues such as questioning the overall volumes of unsustainable consumption. In the absence of more specific guidelines, the strategies for ensuring SCP can be deduced from the means of implementation (MOI) covered by SDG12. However, only the technological, capacity-building, policy, and monitoring aspects of implementation are mentioned in SDG12, and the remaining three MOI (finance, partnerships, and trade) are left unaddressed. Drawing on the premise that resource efficiency, voluntarism, and a business-friendly regulatory approach are the defining elements of SDG12, this chapter identifies concrete implementation opportunities and sheds light on neglected SCP issues. Sustainable production opportunities pivot around circular economy practices in the design, sourcing, and creation of new business models. Regarding sustainable consumption, applying learnings from behavioral economics is key to changing consumption patterns, which can be influenced by both private green marketing campaigns and public green nudge programs. The framing of SDG12 promotes a transition toward SCP that is reliant on business solutions, incremental technological improvements, and consumer voluntary action. Carbon pricing can support such transition by accelerating business investment decisions, preventing rebound effects from efficiency gains, and incentivizing behavior change by sending a price signal to consumers.","Development; Means Of Implementation; Sdg; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Production","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204515611"

Although the area under cereals is declining overtime, still it occupies a major share in the cropping pattern. High risk in crop farming as evidenced by large inter-year variations in the productivity of major rain fed crops is evident in the region. In rainy season, to avoid the risk from crop failure, crops are mostly sown as mixed crops with as many as five to six crops sown together on the same field. Such crop mix includes cereal crops, pulse crops, oilseed crops, cluster bean and sometimes fruits and vegetable crops. A popular crop mixture is pearl millet cluster bean, cowpea, green gram, moth bean, sesame and melon so as to meet the household food consumption requirements, feed requirements for animals and to minimize risk arising from moisture availability during growth phases of crops. The major constraints for sustainable agriculture in Thar region may be classified as climatic (high temperature and wind speed, erratic and scanty rains, recurrent drought, etc.); edaphic (poor quality soil with low fertility and low capacity for water retention, dune topography with wind erosion, etc.) and water related (inade-quate surface water, depleting ground water, etc.). Still mixed crop production with cereals, pulses, oil ‘crop, fodder crop and others may be encouraged with adequate technological support to avert risk and also to ensure food for the people and fodder for animals. Focused agricultural technologies and management practices to reduce inter-year yield instability assume importance.","Constraints; Crop Production; Farming Systems; Field Practices; Mixed Cropping","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202840557"

The frame-work consists of the Waste Management Act, the Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources, specific recycling acts (containers and pack-aging, home appliances, food waste, construction and demolition material, end-of-life vehicles, and small home appliances), and other specific acts and policy tools on Promoting Green Procurement from multiple perspectives.

Japan has recently faced stagnation in primary resource consumption and resource productivity and hence, strengthening measures to achieve the transition to CE through its SMCS policies including addressing marine plastic litter.

Design materialises concepts and leads therefore to realities; accordingly, it is important to provide a design education that acknowledges the significant changes design could make when loaded with ethical values. Ecofeminism is a philosophical current that involves the intersectionality of feminism and ecology, concepts that encompass gender and sustainability. Ecofeminist politics work with a focus on women and non-human nature, with the aim of liberation from power interactions and marginalisation inside society structures, gender equality, and ecology. Consequently, an ecofeminist design perspective is committed to having a care-centric vision towards gender and environmental protection. This proposal presents a collaborative methodology using utopian theory as a creative strategy for learning. Utopia is the idealistic illusion of a perfect reality, thus, utopia as a vision can be the trigger to reflect on the paths our society should follow for further development. Furthermore, feminist utopia focuses on building the bridge between reality and illusion, thus, utopia is a precise cognitive act that could be a beneficial tool for design creation. Unifying ecofeminist philosophy and feminist utopian thinking, this paper presents an innovative way of working with ethical considerations in product design. Hence, it aims to improve the awareness of the need for a sustainable society in future designers, engaging them with some of the UN Sustainable Development Goals such as 5. Gender equality and 12.

Social marketers are committed to people’s health and well-being; they are not profit-oriented and are seeking a larger market share than commercial marketers. One such example is “Community for Brunei” the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative by BIBD. It is an online marketplace designed to help small businesses, highlighting different social and philanthropic causes that are important to Bruneians’ nurturing identity. BIBD assists the country’s small, medium, and micro entrepreneurs to actively and competitively expand their businesses through the Brunei community. It aims to help ease and transform the marketplace for struggling entrepreneurs during the pandemic. The Brunei Community Platform uses technology to bring communities together and provide an online ecosystem with integrated digital payment gateways as part of their efforts to encourage a digital society driven by a cashless economy. Other than a digital marketplace, the Community for Brunei has evolved into a social charitable platform conducting charity drives in collaboration with other non-government organizations as well as a donation platform enabling the community to donate and give back to the nation in difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of BIBD’s overall commitment to maintain the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, events related to Community for Brunei also guards urban areas to ensure its safety, resilience and sustainability. BIBD’s CSR projects also promotes sustainability in consumption and clean production patterns, and takes urgent action by responding to climate change and its impact. The key takeaways of BIBD’s digital platform Community for Brunei is not only to accept but to fully embrace digitization of today’s businesses to not only continue thriving in this very restricted and scarcely resourced environment but to also open up opportunities to enter their goods and services into the global market. It has also become a community-driven and socially responsible platform providing a place for the society to give back to the community.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Digital Marketplace; Digitization; Social Marketer; Sustainable Development Goal (sdg)","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172153886"

Achieving Action Track 1‘s goal is essential to achieving the goals of the other Action Tracks. With less than a decade left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), most countries are not on a course to hit either the World Health Organisation’s nutrition targets or the SDG 2 targets. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated malnutrition and highlighted the need for food safety. The pandemic has also exposed the deep inequalities in both food systems and societies as a whole. Nonetheless, future food systems can address many of these failings and ensure safe and nutritious food for all. However, structural change is necessary to address the socio-economic drivers behind malnutrition, inequalities and the climate and environmental impacts of food. Adopting a whole-system approach in policy, research and monitoring and evaluation is crucial for managing trade-off and externalities from farm-level to national scales and across multiple sectors and agencies. Supply chain failures will need to be overcome and technology solutions adopted and adapted to specific contexts. A transformation of food systems requires coordinating changes in supply and demand in differentiated ways across world regions: bridging yield gaps and improving livestock feed conversion, largely through agro-ecological practices, deploying soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation at scale, and reducing food loss and waste, as well as addressing over-nourishment and shifting the diets of wealthy populations. The sustainability of global food systems also requires halting the expansion of agriculture into fragile ecosystems, while restoring degraded forests, fisheries, rangelands, peatlands and wetlands. Shifting to more sustainable consumption and production patterns within planetary boundaries will require efforts to influence food demand and diets, diversify food systems, and develop careful land-use planning and management. Integrative policies need to ensure that food prices reflect real costs (including major externalities caused by climate change, land degradation and biodiversity loss, and the public health impacts of malnutrition), reduce food waste and, at the same time, ensure the affordability of safe and healthy food and decent incomes and wages for farmers and food system workers. The harnessing of science and technology solutions and the sharing of actionable knowledge with all players in the food system offer many opportunities. Greater coordination of food system stakeholders is crucial for greater inclusion, greater transparency and more accountability. Sharing lessons and experiences will foster adaptive learning and responsive actions. Careful consideration of the trade-offs, externalities and costs of not acting is needed to ensure that the changes we make benefit all, and especially the most vulnerable in society.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161222960"

This is inhibited by a lack of customer focus when implementing circular projects today. To address this challenge, this study presents an in-depth study of a real-world project on repurposing electric vehicle batteries in stationary battery energy storage systems in Germany, which serves to investigate the role of market- and customer requirements in implementing CBM. By combining quantitative analysis based on secondary sources with primary qualitative data collected at different stages of the project, the study offers unique insights into the practical key tasks for ensuring economic viability of circular projects from a multi-stakeholder perspective. These are identified as: i) Develop the product platform, ii) assess multiple value streams, iii) leverage on resource value, iv) provide risk assurances on product quality, v) observe trends in targeted downstream markets, vi) acquire access to suitable financial capital and vii) carry out pilot projects under market conditions. By addressing these tasks, the value captured in terms of the contribution of repurposing to the reduction of battery life cycle cost is found to be 109€/kWh in the case investigated. Based on the findings, the study concludes that implementing circular projects requires companies to provide resource, time and technical expertise for coordinating the identified key tasks and achieve competitiveness with linear alternatives. For future research, we hence suggest further investigation of the use of customer-oriented methods for assessing and developing CBM, as well as required policy-action to ensure commercial viability of CE strategies in industry.","Battery Energy Storage System; Circular Business Models; Circular Economy; Life Cycle Cost; Net Present Value; Second Life; Battery Storage; Commerce; Digital Storage; Electric Vehicles; Life Cycle; Risk Assessment; Sales; Secondary Batteries; Battery Energy Storage Systems; Business Models; Circular Business Model; Circular Economy; Economic Viability; Life Cycle Cost; Real World Projects; Repurposing; Second Life; The Net Present Value (npv); Costs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144473136"

Considering the varying emission intensity in production in different countries and the expected further increase in livestock product trade in the future, it becomes crucial to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of such embodied GHG emissions for climate change mitigation in the livestock sector. In this study, we aimed to address such gaps and analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and network characteristics of GHG emissions embodied in the international trade of seven major categories of livestock products among 228 world economies during 1986–2017. The results showed that the total volume of GHG emissions embodied in livestock product trade reached 92.0 MT in 2017, accounting for 2.6% of the total emissions from livestock production. Sheep meat has replaced cattle meat as the major contributor to embodied emissions. In 2017, the largest flows of embodied emissions were within Europe, followed by the flows from Oceania to Asia. The fluxes in intra-upper middle and intra-high-income economies accounted for most of the total embodied emissions. Although the global average emission intensity of livestock production declined in these four decades, the trade flows from high to low emission intensity economies increased, especially for cattle and sheep meat. This resulted in an overall increase of contribution from the global livestock trade in GHG emissions from the global livestock sector. Therefore, effective measures and policies must be designed from both consumption and production perspectives to ensure proper accounting of these embodied emissions and maximize the reduction potential for a sustainable food system transition.","Complex Network Analysis; Embodied Emissions; International Trade; Livestock Product; Greenhouse Gases; Agricultural Emission; Cattle; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gas; International Trade; Livestock Farming; Meat; Policy Making; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; Article; Asia; Bovine; Economic Aspect; Europe; Greenhouse Gas Emission; High Income Country; Livestock; Network Analysis; Nonhuman; Pacific Islands; Sheep; Animal; Commercial Phenomena; International Cooperation; Animals; Cattle; Climate Change; Commerce; Greenhouse Gases; Internationality; Livestock; Sheep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137067541"

Understanding the current scale and trend of the impact of human activities on the ecosystem is the preliminary work to ensure that human activities do not exceed the ecological carrying capacity under the BRI. This study evaluated the ecosystem pressure in countries along the Belt and Road (B&R) from 2000–2017 based on the supply-consumption balance relationship of ecological resources. Net primary productivity (NPP) is taken as the measure of ecological resources, and the supply level and consumption intensity of ecological resources is estimated based on remote sensing data and statistical data, respectively. Results show that thirteen countries with over-consumed ecological resources concentrated in the West Asia/Middle East. Although the intensity of the ecological resource consumption correlated with ecological resource endowments, the ecosystem pressure was determined by social development dependence on the ecological resources at the same ecological resource endowments level. Nearly 80% of countries along the B&R suffered from significantly increased (P < 0.05) ecosystem pressure during 2000–2017, since most of the countries along the B&R were developing countries, and their economic development was highly dependent on ecological resources. Some West Asia/Middle East countries successfully mitigated the ecosystem pressure by importing feed for livestock. Likewise, the Southeast Asian islands benefitted from the import of agricultural products. The results highlight that the BRI should reduce the dependence of social development demands on local ecological resources by international trade for ensuring the increasing ecosystem pressure trend within the ecological carrying capacity.","Ecological Carrying Capacity; Ecosystem Pressure; Green Silk Road; Net Primary Productivity (npp); Remote Sensing; Data Set; Economic Development; Ecosystem Function; Net Primary Production; Remote Sensing; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; Middle East; West Asia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138002146"

Here, we analyzed the data on vegetable consumption, production, trade and eating habits. In addition, we conducted the predictions of vegetable supply in 2030, 2050, and when reached a plateau. The vegetable supply is predicted to increase from 386 g capita−1 day−1 in 2018 by 23–26 g capita−1 day−1 in 2030 and by 97–112 g capita−1 day−1 when it reached a plateau, lower than the recommended level of vegetable intake (300 g capita−1 day−1) when frequently concerning 50% vegetable lose and waste. The regions or countries with top vegetable supply are centred at global vegetable belt, e.g. Eastern Asia, Central Asia, and the Mediterranean basin, including Southern Europe and North Africa. The top vegetable supply is due to climate-dependent greater yield than the area harvested per capita. The regions not far from the global vegetable belt, e.g. South-eastern (Viet Nam), Western Africa (Niger and Mali), and Southern Asia (India), had moderate vegetable supply. These regions are predicted to increase the area harvested more than the yield to keep up with the relatively high vegetable supply in 2030. The developed regions, e.g. Northern America and Western Europe, cannot ensure the required vegetable supply by increased import and yield. Whilst the meat-preferred Caribbean, Central and South America, South-eastern Asia, and Southern Africa currently and will maintain low levels of vegetable supply. Sufficient vegetable supply cannot be guaranteed due to increased meat prefer of customers and decreased vegetable requirements potentially due to urban lifestyle and modern vegetable supply systems. Herein, it is required to reshape the dietary pattern to encourage vegetable intake and increase vegetable availability by fully utilizing the local climate primarily, and then increasing harvested area and advanced horticultural technology, thus achieving sustainable food production and a healthy diet.","Dietary Pattern; Horticultural Technology; Human Nutrition; Plant-based Diet; Vegetable Intake; Vegetable Yield; Harvesting; Nutrition; Dietary Patterns; Food Production; Healthy Diet; Horticultural Technology; Human Health; Human Nutrition; Plant-based Diets; Sustainable Production; Vegetable Intake; Vegetable Yield; Vegetables","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135684636"

Therefore, their use is growing on a large scale and, moreover, is often used preventively without considering the ecological impact. Studies demonstrated harmful effects on non-target organisms, which in turn negatively impact biodiversity and thus food production. The dramatic decline of honey bee colonies, for example, could be linked to the use of neonicotinoids. Ecologically sustainable solutions to this conflict must be focused by scientific research. The question arose whether the global research efforts meet these requirements on a global scale. Therefore, this review article aimed to analyze the global research landscape on neonicotinoids under ecological, economic, and temporal aspects. To this end, key players and incentives for investigations in this research field are identified. The increase in publications over time is significant and shows a dynamic citation pattern. It indicates a comparatively high interest in current research, with ecological issues becoming more and more the focus of international research. It has been shown that national publication performance and funding are in line with global market interests, with the most publishing country being China. In addition, the elevated status quo of the scientific infrastructure in high-economy countries and their willingness to support research can be linked to national research output. Lower economies are sparsely involved in published studies. The research performance accumulates with a high North-South divide. Therefore, future research projects must have a sustainable focus and take regional requirements worldwide into account. This requires greater involvement of developing countries as the most economically dependent regions with enormously increasing consumption rates. Solutions must be found to ensure sustainable food production against a backdrop of already declining biodiversity due to the large-scale use of neonicotinoids.","Bees; Bibliometrics; Biodiversity; Environmental Risks; Insecticides; Pesticides; Pollinator Populations; Insecticides; Neonicotinoids; Neonicotinoid; Insecticide; Biodiversity; Environmental Risk; Food Production; Honeybee; Neonicotinoid Pesticide; Pesticide; Pollinator; China; Citation Analysis; Developing Country; Ecology; Food Industry; Funding; Geographic Distribution; Human; Incentive; Market; Medical Research; Nonhuman; Publication; Publishing; Review; Scientist; Socioeconomic Parameters; Animal; Bee; Animals; Bees; Biodiversity; Insecticides; Neonicotinoids","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132515981"

The physical properties of the SEBS/PP polymer blends were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In addition, measurements of the mechanical strength (tensile strength and Young’s modulus) as per ASTM 638, polymer hardness was tested using a durometer and swelling was analysed through water absorption and compared with commercial PVC-based blood bags. The results indicate that the SEBS/PP 50/50 blend has approximately similar characteristics as PVC-based blood bags.

This paper portrays the existing connection between glycerol and the polymer industry, particularly as a feedstock for polymer synthesis and its role as a plasticizer in the starch polymer. Glycerol is a potential bio-based material to afford prominent biocompatible yet biodegradable polymers for a variety of applications through direct polymerization, fermentation, and chemical conversion. Besides, glycerol plays a critical role in the food packaging industry to perform a plasticizing effect; it improves the ductility of the bio-derived packaging. The native unplasticized starch film is too brittle for handling, while the glycerol-plasticized starch film has adequate flexibility and processability, but with compromised water and gaseous barrier properties.

Several studies have presented evidence that changes in dietary patterns across the world can lead to win-win outcomes for environmental and social sustainability and can complement ongoing technological and policy efforts to improve the efficiency of agricultural production. However, the existing evidence have been compiled in “silos” by a large range of researchers across several disciplines using different indicators. The aim of this quantitative review is to bring together the existing knowledge on heterogeneity of current dietary patterns across the world and how a transition toward healthy diets in different countries can aid in progress toward multiple global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We first summarize the nutritional quality, economic cost, and environmental footprint of current diets of over 150 countries using multiple indicators. Next, we review which shifts in dietary patterns across different world regions can help toward achievement of SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and wellbeing), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG13 (Climate action), SDG14 (Life below water), and SDG15 (Life on land). Finally, we briefly discuss how to enable the shift toward sustainable dietary patterns and identify the research and data gaps that need to be filled through future efforts. Our analysis reveals that dietary change is necessary in all countries as each one has unique priorities and action items. For regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, increased intake of nutrient dense foods is needed to address deficiency of essential nutrients like folate, potassium, and vitamin A. For North America and Europe, shifting toward more plant-based diets would be healthier and simultaneously reduce the per capita environmental footprints. The results can be useful for policymakers in designing country-specific strategies for adoption of sustainable dietary behaviors and for food industry to ensure the supply of sustainable food items customized with regions' need.","Climate-change; Dietary Change; Environment; Malnutrition; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs)","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134580302"

The proposed strategy is designed to ensure sustainable and cost-effective operations by managing the energy flows in the grid, and is structured so to cope with: (1) high levels of renewable power penetration, and (2) load profiles characterized by non-smooth patterns and irregular events (i.e., events such as those occurring from connections/disconnections of large scale equipment, or from large wind speed ramps). The proposed algorithm leverages a stochastic economic model predictive control (MPC) scheme capable of dealing simultaneously with the dispatch and scheduling of the local generation units. More precisely, the scheme embeds a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimal control policy formulation together with a stochastic programming approach. Moreover, the optimization problem accounts for multiple techno-economical objectives, such as minimization of operational costs, battery degradation, and non-utilized energy. We test the algorithm on a case study of an isolated offshore Oil & Gas platform producing energy onsite with conventional gas turbines and a local wind farm, while integrating a battery energy storage system. The results show that the proposed approach can issue ensemble predictions that successfully capture the potential irregular variations just by using recent past information of the associated random variable, even when no particular sudden events are anticipated in the near-future (i.e., step changes/trend reversals). In this way, the approach provides useful future information for the optimal management of the grid. This effect is numerically quantified via simulations that compare the performance of the proposed stochastic optimization approach against its deterministic MPC version in several realistic operating conditions. The empirical results suggest that the stochastic version leads to better scheduling of the conventional generators, with up to 12.86% reductions of the operating cost, 2.56% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions, and 35.29% reduction in status transitions (on/off) of the gas turbines, while keeping dumped energy and battery degradation as low as possible.","Economic Mpc; Energy Storage; Isolated Power Systems; Mixed-integer Linear Programming; Offshore Wind Power; Quantile Regression; Random Forests; Stochastic Model Predictive Control; Cost Effectiveness; Costs; Decision Trees; Digital Storage; Electric Load Dispatching; Energy Efficiency; Energy Management; Energy Management Systems; Energy Storage; Gas Emissions; Information Management; Information Use; Integer Programming; Offshore Oil Well Production; Predictive Control Systems; Scheduling; Stochastic Models; Stochastic Systems; Wind; Economic Model Predictive Control; Economic Models; Integer Linear Programming; Isolated Power System; Mixed Integer Linear; Mixed-integer Linear Programming; Model-predictive Control; Off-shore Wind Power; Quantile Regression; Stochastic Model Predictive Controls; Model Predictive Control; Algorithm; Energy Management; Energy Storage; Fuel Consumption; Linear Programing; Optimization; Wind Velocity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126853644"

Since the 70s, the processes involving the USWM have undergone changes influenced by the behaviour of the generator, consumption patterns, impacts on the environment and by economic, political and social transformations. Although the need to reinsert waste into the production chain seems to be a consensus, scientific investigations point to clear regional differences in terms of management direction. As a result, this reveals a scenario composed of regions that managed to adhere to the principles of circular waste management, and others, especially those of medium and low income, which were able to neutralise problems inherent to the primary processes of management, such as collection and final disposal. Factors such as technical and financial capacity, legislation, regulation/inspection and the involvement of society in the discussions and deliberations related to the waste sector, have also been pointed out by the literature as determining the dimension of the advance or delay of the USWM. In this sense, the analysis of the different performances of the USWM of the countries, states, and/or municipalities and the identification of the factors that provoke this differentiation, are essential to point out, what the challenges and perspectives for promoting the advancement of the USWM are, according to the investigated local reality. The present research is descriptive and exploratory and has a general objective: to analyse the profile of the USWM of 786 Brazilian municipalities regarding the waste collection process and the adequacy of municipalities with the National Solid Waste Policy-NSWP (Law 12.305/ 2010), and discuss possible external factors of influence. The year evaluated corresponds to 2018 and the empirical analyses involved the municipalities which have all the model variables available in the National Sanitation Information System-SNIS base. For the optimisation of the investigation, the cities were classified into clusters according to the population, and the analyses were parameterised by 8 qualitative variables (Type of Management, Payment of the Generator, Municipal Waste Plan, Social Control, Regulation/Inspection Sector, Selective Collection, Cooperatives/Associations and Final Disposal System), and by 5 quantitative variables (Collection Expenses, Number of Employees, Number of Vehicles, Volume of Solid Urban Waste Collected and Population Served). To perceive possible influences of external factors in the USWM, analyses of the municipalities were carried out at regional level, using 8 socioeconomic indicators, called exogenous variables: Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), MHDI-Income, Population, Density Demographic, Gross Domestic Product per capita, Income per capita, Percentage of hospitalisations because of diseases related to inadequate sanitation, and Percentage of people of 25 years of age or older with a college degree. Data from the municipalities were extracted from the following Brazilian electronic platforms: SNIS (2019), Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística-IBGE (2010; 2017) and Atlas Brasil (2010, 2017), and the theoretical foundation was supported by international scientific references and Brazilians. The analyses carried out made it possible to achieve the following specific objectives: i. present the status of the municipal solid waste collection process in order to provide input for future analysis of the USWM efficiency; ii. verify the adherence of municipalities to the guidelines of Law 12.305/2010; iii. make inferences about the magnitude of the analysis variables in the municipalities by Population Class, by Management Type and by Payment of the Generator; iv. present and discuss the profile of municipalities at regional level and v. identify the municipalities with greater adherence to the legislation's criteria, discussing the influence of external factors. Cluster analysis showed a greater tendency to suit the USWM in municipalities belonging to the largest population groups: (100.000 to 500.000 inhabitants) and (>500.000 inhabitants). The Autarchy and the Mixed Economy Society stood out as management models with a greater tendency towards adequacy and the payment of the generator is also suggested as an influencing variable for the adequacy of the USWM. Of the total number of municipalities evaluated, only 5,6% or 44 showed greater alignment with the NSWP guidelines, having the following profile: 91% are located in the most developed regions of the country (South and Southeast); have an average GDP higher than the national average; have a high degree of MHDI, being among the 200 Brazilian municipalities with the highest MHDI; have a very high degree of MHDI-Income, being among the 120 municipalities with the highest MHDI.","Brazil; Municipalities; Urban Solid Waste Management; Economic And Social Effects; Factor Analysis; Human Resource Management; Solid Wastes; Sustainable Development; Waste Disposal; Brazil; Collection Process; External Factors; Final Disposals; Municipal Human Development Indices; Municipality; Regional Levels; Solid Waste Management; Urban Solid Waste Management; Urban Waste Management; Laws And Legislation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137165587"

Water shortages and groundwater overexploitation are key constraints to the sustainable development of the BTH region. Agricultural water use dominates regional water withdrawal, accounting for 70% of all water use, and the irrigation of high-intensity cropping systems has caused notable groundwater depletion over the past several decades. In this study, the historical stage characteristics of agricultural production scale and irrigation expansion were analyzed based on statistical data. Before 1949, irrigated farmland was mainly located in the piedmont plain of the Taihang Mountains for high-value crop production, irrigation scale and water withdrawal were limited. After 1949, electromechanical irrigation wells gradually replaced traditional shallow wells, and irrigation became a conventional measure for crop production. Since the end of the 1970s, a well-irrigated system has covered the BTH region. Groundwater irrigation provided dominant support for stable agricultural production and sustained high yield. The wheat-maize double-cropping system was enhanced. Simultaneously, the production capacity of fruits and vegetables increased rapidly. The output of grain crops increased from 2.1362×107 t to 3.9448×107 t, an increase of 84.7%. Vegetable production increased from 1.0937×107 t to 5.5084×107 t, an increase of 403.6%. The fruit output increased from 1.440×106 t to 1.5052×107 t, with a 945.6% increase. High yields depended on adequate irrigation, and groundwater depletion occurred as a result of a trade-off between water and agricultural products in the BTH region. Over the last four decades, agricultural production in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei has diverged in terms of scale and structure. The crop planting areas of Beijing and Tianjin decreased by 85.0% and 38.7%, respectively. Beijing has almost abandoned grain crop production, but the agricultural production capacity of Hebei Province has further increased. In 2018, 93.8% of grains, 99.1% of oilseeds, 92.9% of cotton, 93.1% of vegetables, and 91.7% of fruits in the BTH region were contributed by Hebei Province. This pattern of differentiation intensified the importance of agricultural production in Hebei Province in the BTH region, which has reliably increased the pressure on agricultural production and water withdrawal in Hebei Province. Studies have explored cropping systems that are more sustainable for groundwater sustainability. Based on field experiments and crop models, it was confirmed that reducing planting intensity can help mitigate groundwater decline, and winter wheat has been reported to be the main contributor to groundwater consumption. The cropping system of three harvests over two years has been suggested as a better alternative cropping system for water savings than the current winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, which could save more water each year with a slight grain yield loss. However, the interaction between grain production capacity and water consumption intensity on medium- and long-term time scales for different water-adapting rotations of crops remains unclear and insufficient. From a policy-making perspective, it is necessary to improve the comprehensive agricultural plan under the conditions of the BTH coordinated development strategy. To ensure regional food security and stable agriculture, the water-adapting transformation of agricultural production in the BTH region should be promoted in an orderly and efficient manner.","Beijing-tianjin-hebei Region; Crop Production; Irrigation; Water Consumption; Water-adapting Agriculture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129741615"

More specifically, consumer waste is the largest contributor to the food waste problem when compared with other steps along the supply chain, such as production, post-harvest handling and storage, processing, and distribution. Furthermore, American families discard approximately 25% of the food and beverages they buy.

A variety of factors contribute to why consumers waste so much food. For dairy, commonly referenced reasons are related to the misunderstanding of date labels, poor planning of purchases, spoilage before consuming products, and improper storage. This wasted food accumulates in landfills and produces methane when decomposing, resulting in environmental consequences related to ozone depletion and climate change. Milk can have negative environmental impacts when disposed of down the drain. This review will discuss the food waste problem, causes, and potential solutions at the consumer level, with particular focus on dairy waste. An individual plus policy, system, and environment approach will also be integrated to provide a well-rounded view of the issue.","Dairy; Food Waste; Milk; Personal And Planetary Health; Animal; Fruit; Human; Milk; Policy; United States; Vegetable; Waste Disposal; Animals; Fruit; Humans; Milk; Policy; Refuse Disposal; Vegetables","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126547054"

Individual level data were selected from a sample of 59 executive managers of different domains representing agro-food businesses, agro-food cooperatives, and agro-food consulting firms and public institutions. The empirical analysis addressed the effects of the COVID-19 crisis to all the stages in the food chain and attempted to indicate the factors that could influence the trajectory from “farm to fork” under uncertain circumstances. Factor analysis elicited the underlying dimensions of experts' viewpoints toward the operation of the food system during COVID-19 pandemic. Data were also elaborated through hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis and the cluster structure was further validated by discriminant analysis. A two-cluster solution emerged, revealing differences in experts' perceptions toward the aftermath of the pandemic on agriculture (socioeconomic impacts on rural areas, impacts on agricultural production), food processing businesses (decline in the economic viability of food businesses, sharp economic downturn in the food industry, economic recession, incentives for innovation), food distribution networks (distribution channels fallout, food supply disruption), and consumers' food habits and preferences (increasing interest in health protection, adoption of unhealthy eating habits, demand for innovative and sustainable foods). These segments were identified as “skeptical food experts about COVID-19 impacts” (33.9%) and “alarmed food experts about COVID-19 impacts” (66.1%). Our findings highlighted the main disruptions that the food sector should overcome to meet consumer demand for safe and healthy food products and also ensure food availability and food system resiliency.","Agro-food Production; Covid-19; Factor Analysis; Food Consumption Emerging Trends; Food Expert Clusters; Food Supply Networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129278558"

One of the UAE sustainable development goals is to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns; hence, the emphasis is on circular economy. UAE is one of largest consumers of e-devices, and their proper disposal is of paramount importance. E-waste disposal awareness leads to better disposal behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to understand the e-device purchase and disposal behaviour among university communities in the UAE. A survey was conducted among the students and staff members of a federally funded university in the UAE, namely Zayed University, and quantitative methodology was adopted to analyze the collected data. The study found that 47.95% of respondents purchased mobile phones, and 65% of the respondents purchased 1–3 electronic devices every year. Through chi-square test, gender of the respondents was found to be related with e-device ownership. Through the analysis of variance (ANOVA), age and field of specialization were found to affect the knowledge about e-waste. Older and the respondents with science specialization were more aware about e-waste. Most of the respondents disposed e-devices, such as batteries, earphones/headphones, and electronic toys, along with the household trash. A very small percentage of respondents disposed e-devices such as laptops, phones, and tablets with the household trash. Mostly, these were either repaired, donated, or sold to second-hand users. Many respondents were neither aware of the government initiatives on e-waste collection nor participated in government-sponsored e-waste recycling. The study further identified that 67% of the respondents were aware of the toxicity of e-waste, and 61% of the respondents were keen to join e-waste recycling drives at university. The findings of the study imply that the policy makers need to incentivize e-waste-disposal systems and develop targeted awareness approaches to enhance e-waste disposal in the UAE.","E-device Disposal Behaviour; E-device Purchase; E-waste Awareness; E-waste Recycling; Electronic Waste; Waste Disposal; United Arab Emirates","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129211733"

This has been provoked by rapid increases in mobile data traffic and projected further rapid increases over the next decade. As a result, dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of mobile networks are required to ensure that future traffic levels are both environmentally and economically sustainable. In this context, a good deal of research has focused on technologies and strategies that can improve the energy efficiency of 5G and future mobile networks more broadly. However, existing reviews in the field of green or sustainable mobile communications on the topic of the energy use implications of 5G overlook a number of issues that broader literatures on the energy use impacts of ICTs suggest could be significant. Addressing this gap, we conduct a literature review to examine whole network level assessments of the operational energy use implications of 5G, the embodied energy use associated with 5G, and indirect effects associated with 5G-driven changes in user behaviour and patterns of consumption and production in other sectors of the economy.

The use of plastics is having significant negative effects on the environment and so numerous policies such as the use of biodegradable packaging, have been implemented to ensure sustainable production and consumption patterns (Sustainable Development Goal 12). This paper aims to analyse the background factors that explain consumer intention to use bioplastics with the aim of guiding company and government social marketing campaigns designed to encourage such behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: To gather data, a survey was carried out using a sample of 3,612 people obtained via an online panel made up of participants over 18 years of age. The model and its hypotheses were tested by structural equations with the PLS technique using six independent variables obtained from the literature review. Findings: The results of the variables “attitude towards bioplastics”, “subjective norms” and “activity to reduce plastic use” show a significant influence on intention to use bioplastics. This paper will also discuss the implications for governments and environmental managers to be taken into account when developing social marketing campaigns. Social implications: Given the importance of perceived social pressure in terms of behaviour regarding the use of recyclable bioplastics, social marketing campaigns may be developed to encourage environmentally-responsible behaviour amongst different social agents such as consumers, businesses, governmental organisations and suppliers. Originality/value: This study demonstrates the factors that explain intentions to use bioplastics, which until now had been subject to very little research.","Bioplastics; Consumer Behaviour; Environment; Social Marketing; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109369155"

Particularly, the Mediterranean Basin is an agroecological diversity hotspot with an extraordinary variety of raw materials that allow the agri-food industry to offer a very large number of traditional food products. The ValICET project (Valorise foods and Improve Competitiveness through Emerging Technologies applied to food by-products within the circular economy framework) has been funded by PRIMA (Section 2), framed in the Thematic Area 3-Agrofood chain, according to Goals 2 and 12 of Agenda 2030 of the European Union to ensure “Zero hunger” and “Sustainable consumption and production patterns”. ValICET aims at developing innovative and sustainable processing solutions capable of converting agri-food residues into sustainable natural high-added value compounds to be reincorporated into the food supply chain to extend the shelf-life of traditional Mediterranean food products within the framework of the circular economy. Among different strategies, it is included the development of active coatings and other food contact materials using bioactives/extracts obtained from different by-products. During the development of these new materials, and as a part of the evaluation of their effectiveness as active materials, migration assays are an important tool to study the release of active compounds intended to act as antioxidant or antimicrobial compounds. In this communication, the project ValICET will be presented, focusing on the different materials developed as a potential strategy to contribute to the circular economy and decrease the negative environmental impact of the traditional food contact materials. Several examples will highlight the value of the migration assays and the analytical methods developed to determine the key compounds when the activity of these materials is evaluated.","Active Materials; By-products; Migration Assays; Phenolic Compounds; Films; Supply Chains; Sustainable Development; Waste Disposal; Active Films; Active Material; Agri-food Industry; Circular Economy; Food Contact Material; Industrial By-products; Large Amounts; Migration Assay; Phenolic Compounds; Traditional Food; Environmental Impact","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192554740"

The products of and a complete dependency on the practices of deforestation and industrialized extractive mining for electronics have compounded the historical exploitation of both natural resources and human labour from developing countries. Many of these countries still suffer the consequences of colonialism from previous centuries and are now exploited for the enrichment of modern leading economies through waging war, testing nuclear weapons, increased urbanization and industrialization, continued deforestation, and extractive mining. Extractive mining on an industrial scale for the continued unsustainable consumption of electronic technology decimates the natural environment and contributes to ground water contamination and displacement of indigenous peoples. These practices were always unsustainable and are not ethically acceptable. Learning selective breeding practices of native crops from resilient groups of indigenous people or migratory farmers can and must be studied for future food security. We have a chance to change the trajectory of human history and life on Earth. Herein, I present how and why this knowledge can be respectfully studied with mindful engagement and be applied to sustainable activities supporting missions in Space. Acknowledgement of prior mismanagement of natural resources is important because failure can provide teachable examples for sustainability in space activities.

The difference between climate change now and in the past is that of sudden and disproportionate disruption of the natural energy dynamics by the changing consumption patterns of billions of human beings who have polluted terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The picture that emerges from the exhaustive analysis of international data drawn from the most reliable sources indicates that we have possibly gained access to the gateway of extinction and it is time that we take corrective steps immediately. Global climate change is further altering our relationship with the environment, modifying relatively stable climatic factors and making them uncertain, unpredictable, and threatening. Changes in land use and an increasing demand for water resources due to climate change have affected the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, ensure the supply of freshwater resources, provide ecosystem services, and promote rural multi-functionality. Ensuring food production does not just depend on increasing water efficiency, promoting climate resilient crop production, or reducing land-use competition for urbanization but also on a more suitable and stable climate as the changes in climatic factors like precipitation, temperature, radiation, evaporation, and wind bring about some major shifts in global food supplies. According to Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), focused on greenhouse gas emissions projections, and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change increases the risk of simultaneous crop failures (including corn, rice, legumes, and vegetables) if irrigation systems are not fully adapted to water stress situations. A changing climate could have many adverse impacts on other sectors of our environment.

The most critical challenge to achieve sustainable development is climate change, disrupting national economies, and human lives. Changes in the weather patterns and temperature rising becoming more severe. Thus, saving lives and livelihoods become an urgent action with better know-how and available options to avert the challenge and build opportunities to achieve sustainable development. Consumption and production vision for environmentally sustainable economic development will allow climate security and other environmental concerns. Besides, what is not well understood is what consequences this will have for vulnerable states and how best to deal with them. A nation's vulnerability to climate change can be defined as the degree to which it is at risk of being negatively impacted by climate change. In this chapter, we investigated the cause for nations to be at a greater risk of climate change than others from different dimensions such as social, economic, cultural, and environmental. Apart from that, the effects of climate change can be seen from ASEAN countries' perspective due to constraints in financial flows, technology, and capacity building to reduce emissions. Hence, the importance of technology innovation, regulatory protection, and relevant policies were also discussed to mitigate climate change. Finally, a practical framework like sustainomics and commitment from all countries were recommended to ensure a more sustainable and equitable society with zero emissions.","Asean; Climate Change; Policies; Sustainable Development; Sustainomics; Vulnerable Nation","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137871683"

Industrial and systems engineers often lead or play a major role in selecting the optimal site for a new facility and then in the design, construction, and commissioning of the new operations. ISEs have long used tools to optimize the location of a facility based on factors like cost, the location of suppliers, the location of customers, etc. With the advent of sustainability, we have been asked to incorporate new factors like the environmental impact and the social impact of the new facilities. Traditional methods and optimization criteria have often led to new facilities that have had devastating environmental, health and economic effects on communities of color, rural “poverty pockets,” and economically impoverished Native-American reservations. Environmental justice initiatives seek to not only level the playing field but take into consideration the exiting impacts of past decisions when proposing new facilities that may increase the burden on these under-served populations.

We evaluated the short-term effects of Ni application on field-grown soybean yield, growth, and soil chemical attributes using three sources of SAA, two enriched with Ni (Ni-rich mining by-product and Ni-salt) and a commercial SAA. The tested Ni-enriched sources were effective in providing Ni to the soil at safe levels, neutralizing acidity and increasing base saturation. A one-time Ni application resulted in optimal Ni levels in the first cropping season, enhancing grain yield by up to 658 kg ha−1 and improving nitrogen metabolism in soybean. A low residual effect of Ni was observed in the second year, with soil available Ni and plant Ni concentrations decreasing to sub-optimal levels and yield gains not being observed. In conclusion, the application of Ni-enriched SAA is a sustainable technology for agriculture, optimizing soil management practices. The SAA derived from by-products has benefits to the mining sector, meeting the ‘Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns’ (SDG 12). Our findings suggest that this micronutrient may require a year-to-year adjustment via Ni-fertilization and the total Ni concentration in the soil should be monitored over the cropping seasons.","By-product; Liming; Ni-fertilizer; Sdg 12; Tropical Soil","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105034993"

To ensure food security and a sustainable food system, dietary changes have been identified as one of the valuable strategies to reduce impacts on the environment while promoting human health. The vast majority of scientific literature has been focused on the effects of food consumption on climate change while neglecting to assess the degree of water scarcity impacts due to water consumption embodied in food. The research paper investigates the nexus between food consumption and impacts on water consumption adding important findings to a more recent growing body of studies estimating the water footprint (WF) of different dietary scenarios. This study uses the Water Footprint Network methodology and the AWARE (Available Water REmaining) characterization model to assess both the WF and the blue WSF (water scarcity footprint), respectively, of four Danish diets: standard, carnivore, vegetarian and vegan. In order to make them comparable, a total intake of 2000 kcal person−1 day−1 was set as energetic reference for all the diet scenarios considered. Using detailed trade and production data of agri-foods, we were able to assess the location of primary production and consequently to reveal countries mainly affected by water scarcity associated with import to satisfy Danish diets consumption. We found that while the vegan scenario scored the best environmental profile requiring 1489 L/cap/day calculated with the volumetric WF approach, it has the largest potential impacts on blue WSF of 10,477 L<inf>H20-eq</inf>/cap/day. This study has shown that more than 90% of impacts on water consumption occur outside the national borders, as a consequence of large quantities of fruits and nuts imported by countries already threatened by high water scarcity conditions such as USA and Mediterranean regions. This methodological approach may be used to compare environmental performances of recommended dietary guidelines and to assess impact scenarios of new trade policies, protecting local water scarcity levels.","Denmark; Dietary Guidelines; Sustainable Diet; Water Dependency; Water Use; Water; Water; Commerce; Environmental Impact; Environmental Management; Food Supply; Sustainable Development; Water Supply; Blue Water; Denmark; Dietary Guidelines; Food Consumption; Sustainable Diet; Water Consumption; Water Dependency; Water Footprint; Water Scarcity; Water Use; Climate Change; Water; Climate Change; Environmental Impact; Food Consumption; Import; Water Use; Adult; Article; Beverage; Body Water; Carnivore; Condiment; Controlled Study; Danish Citizen; Dietary Pattern; Female; Fluid Intake; Food Intake; Food Waste; Fruit; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nonhuman; Vegan Diet; Vegetable; Vegetarian; Vegetarian Diet; Water Insecurity; Water Stress; Water Supply; Diet; Nutrition Policy; Southern Europe; Mediterranean Region; United States; Diet; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Water","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115149242"

Practical approaches are expected to propose to realize enhancing crop production while towards sustainable development in shallow groundwater area. This study integrates a process-based model, multi-objectives, and fuzzy theory into optimization model to optimize crops water allocation pattern under uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater. The process-based model considers the water exchange between soil and groundwater, water stress and salt stress on crops, and ground water level changes. The multi-objectives defined in this study balances the conflicts of maximizing crop production, maximizing water use efficiency, and minimizing energy consumption. The uncertain amount of water diversion and groundwater is presented as fuzzy numbers. The optimized water allocation pattern of 3 crops in 12 water supply response units in Hetao Irrigation District show that the crop yield does not necessarily reach to the highest potential value, though wheat and maize are allocated more water than sunflower and have larger possibility to reach high crop yield. Significant energy investment is needed for extracting and purifying groundwater to ensure relatively high crop production at the case of possible low available water. Uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater will cause a greater range of ground water level in wheat field, a high risk of water stress in sunflower field and a high risk of very severe salinization in wheat field. The different changing directions of three sub-objectives demonstrate that optimal water allocation has no uniform rule but changes with available water.","Optimization; Risk; Shallow Groundwater Area; Sustainable Agricultural Development; Uncertainty; Crops; Cultivation; Energy Utilization; Flood Control; Floods; Fuzzy Sets; Groundwater Resources; Investments; Planning; Risk Analysis; Risk Assessment; Sustainable Development; Uncertainty Analysis; Water Levels; Water Supply; Crop Production; Multi Objective; Optimisations; Process-based Modeling; Shallow Groundwater; Shallow Groundwater Area; Sustainable Agricultural Development; Uncertainty; Water Allocations; Water Diversions; Groundwater; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Energy Resource; Maize; Sustainable Development; Water Exchange; Water Level; Water Resource; Water Stress; Water Supply; Water Use; Wheat; China; Hetao; Nei Monggol; Helianthus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116574320"

While most forms of malnutrition can be prevented with simple dietary interventions, both undernutrition and overnutrition remain persistent and burdensome challenges for large portions of the global population, especially for young children who are dependent on others for nourishment. In addition to dietary factors, children’s health also faces the growing challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, pollution, and infectious disease. Food production and consumption practices both sit at the nexus of these issues, and both must be significantly transformed if we are to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Food sources (i.e., animal-source foods vs. plant-source foods), food production practices, the effects of food processing, the impacts of a more globalized food system, and food loss and waste have all been receiving growing attention in health and sustainability research and policy discussions. Much of this work points to recommendations to reduce resource-intensive animal-source foods, heavily processed foods, and foods associated with excessive waste and pollution, while simultaneously increasing plant-source options. However, some of these recommendations require a little more nuance when considered in the context of issues such as global child health. All types of foods can play significant roles in providing essential nutrition for children across the globe, and for improving the well-being and livelihoods of their families and communities. Dairy foods provide a prime example of this need for nuance, as both dairy production practices and consumption patterns vary greatly throughout the world, as do their impacts on child health and food system sustainability. The objective of this narrative review is to highlight the role of dairy in supporting child health in the context of food system sustainability. When considering child health within this context it is recommended to take a holistic approach that considers all four domains of sustainability (health, economics, society, and the environment) to better weigh trade-offs, optimize outcomes, and avoid unintended consequences. To ensure that children have access to nutritious and safe foods within sustainable food systems, special consideration of their needs must be included within the broader food systems transformation narrative.","Child Health; Child Nutrition; Dairy; Food Security; Food Systems; Nutrition; Sustainability; Sustainable Food Systems; Child Development; Child Health; Diet; Food Production; Food Security; Malnutrition; Carbon Footprint; Catering Service; Child Nutrition; Climate Change; Dairy Product; Economic Aspect; Environmental Sustainability; Family Health; Food Availability; Food Industry; Food Safety; Food System Transformation; Health Care Need; Healthy Diet; Human; Review; Wellbeing; Animal; Child; Food; Nutritional Status; Preschool Child; Sustainable Development; Animals; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Food; Food Supply; Humans; Nutritional Status; Sustainable Development","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116599183"

Higher Education Institutions are outstanding agents of change, introducing and implementing sustainability in a holistic way, connecting people, and including social and institutional considerations, with students being a key component of change. This study presents a co-creation model to incorporate sustainability in Higher Education Institutions, integrating all members of the university community with a multidisciplinary approach, seeking to address global needs with development tools for new products and services to facilitate the transition of consumers towards responsible consumption. The model aims to analyze the daily consumption pattern of the community at the university, to identify the degree of commitment to sustainability of its members, and to co-create in search of solutions related to responsible consumption and production. This is achieved through five phases of a model, each with specific tasks and objectives based on co-creation processes and tools. As a result, the model enables stakeholders to understand the needs of their community by actively participating within the five phases for developing more democratic solutions and social involvement regarding sustainability issues that can be solved through a co-creative process. The model combines the benefits through ethnographic techniques to discover habits, tools to involve participation, and co-creation to manage complex problems. Future research will focus on the application of the proposed model to more generalist contexts of society, addressing potential challenges due to vertical collaboration and barriers pre-established by society for the adoption of a sustainable lifestyle.","Co-creation; Consumption Habits; Creative Model; Sustainability Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Development; Consumption Patterns; Degree Of Commitment; Higher Education Institutions; Multi-disciplinary Approach; Products And Services; Sustainability Issues; Sustainable Consumption; Vertical Collaborations; Education Computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108296906"

Consequently, to boost agrarian production and achieve food security, within limited arable land, the effective use of fertilizers becomes critical. However, the economic efficiency of mineral fertilizers has fallen dramatically as the price hike in fertilizers became dearer than food. The current winds of global climate change due to continued emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities have been posing unprecedented challenges before the agriculture sector and fertilizer industry. The limited geological resources of raw material for the manufacture of fertilizers and market fluctuations of fertilizer minerals initiate wide-reaching competition and raise challenge of food security. It is observed since the last century that the production of fertilizer minerals has risen almost constantly; however, consumption varied greatly from one region to another. It remained constant or declined in Western Europe and North America, but increased rapidly in East and South Asia especially in China and India. The Asian share of global fertilizer consumption is more than 60% and growing rapidly. This supply-demand pattern influences mineral fertilizers’ trade-flow and thereby global competition. Hence, there is a need to develop the fertilizer mineral sector and adopt policies and strategies to ensure materials security. The sustainable agricultural intensification and the agronomical proportions, timing, and placement with the right source are crucial factors which determine the sustainable utility of fertilizer minerals. In the wake of the above, we provide a critical appraisal of fertilizer minerals.","Fertilizer Minerals; Food Security; Sustainable Development; Agricultural Intensification; Fertilizer Application; Food Security; Mineral Resource; Sustainable Development; Trend Analysis; India","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099038410"

The history of the Sustainable Development Goal No. 12 (i.e., to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns) is presented and analyzed. A definition of the sustainable consumption is given and the role of education is explained. The present status and existing trends of SCP are introduced by analyzing unsustainable behavior and the existing dilemma, namely sustainable growth or degrowth. A very broad range of methods is used for measuring and evaluating SCP within sustainable development. To forecast the future of SCP, important trends are presented. The future development of SCP will follow several megatrends and it will require reduced personal and collective consumption (degrowth). Energy usage in buildings, renewable energy sources, and energy storage will be important in that respect. Transportation emissions will continue to be lowered. Waste, especially food waste, shall be reduced, and consumer products shall become more durable. All waste must be collected and separated to be reused. SPC is elaborated in view of the two approaches—Industry 4.0 (smart factory), and the “Sixth Wave” evolution. Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, resource efficiency, and zero waste will be at the forefront of future activities. A circular economy requires extension of product lifetimes, and the reuse and recycling of products. Reducing emissions, pollution and specific energy, water, and raw material usage (especially critical raw materials), as well as the role of digitalization, will be important.","Education; Evolution; Policy; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Production; Education; Emission Control; Greenhouse Gas; Industrial Production; Recycling; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113803912"

Different ways of proper utilization of the retrieved materials will be proposed. Specifically, this review article will focus mainly on three main by-products; namely keratinous materials, wool wax, and sericin.

The strategy of the material substitution is the more investigated together with mass reduction, even if the study does not ignore marginally shape optimization, controls, and production processes. Another goal is to discriminate the environmental benefits according to the size of the car and power supply, i.e., gasoline, hybrid and electric. To ensure the reliability and the reproducibility of the results, the study was conducted using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, following the international standards ISO 14040/44, limited to the determination of CO<inf>2</inf> eq. Each considered datum was extracted from scientific papers and used within a rigorous structured methodology to calculate the environmental impacts for all the types of car. The functional unit was defined to refer the environmental benefits arising from each improvement of the components to the impacts of the car life cycle normalized for a distance travelled of 100 km in a typical European route. Overall, a reduction in overall car impacts between 7% and 14% was determined by combining all the best alternatives for each analysed component. The major advantage was guaranteed to internal combustion cars and minor to electric cars, while in terms of size, small car benefitted the most. Frame improvement alone provided 51% of the total impact reduction, followed at a distance by that on the bodywork. In conclusion, the study showed how the followed approach can be useful to combine a large amount of different and heterogeneous data while extracting general considerations for automotive eco-design. The structural lightning achieved through material substitution has been fundamental to reduce fuel and energy consumption, and therefore the impacts of the use phase. However, the moderate lightning ensured by aluminium is better than the larger one of carbon fiber and magnesium, whose greater impacts in material extraction, manufacturing, and end-of-life compromise their most sustainable use phase. A further investigation should be deserved to increase control over vehicle condition and driving patterns which resulted valuable options.","Automotive Sustainability; Lca For Auto Parts; Life Cycle Assessment; Lightweighting; Passenger Cars; Carbon Fibers; Electric Power Systems; Energy Utilization; Environmental Impact; Extraction; Lightning; Sustainable Development; Automotive Sustainability; Control Process; Environmental Benefits; Life Cycle Assessment For Auto Part; Lightweighting; Mass Reduction; Materials Substitutions; Optimization Control; Shape-optimization; Use Phase; Life Cycle","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105450413"

In order for a sustainable consumption to be realized; establishment of institutional organizations that will respond to local production and consumption problems, change of consumption patterns that will lead to waste with flexible and inclusive sustainable communities by re-incorporating waste generated after consumption into production are the determining factors. Consumption patterns are in a continuous cycle of change with the effect of social media and mass media. Mass media crosses all social boundaries and recreates certain perspectives, allowing information to be synthesized and spread continuously. Broadcasting programs that emphasize being a conscious consumer on television, which is one of the mass media, allows the consumption patterns to be shaped in a continuous cycle and the existing patterns to change.

It therefore has a critical socioeconomic value safeguarding against food and nutrition insecurity. Maize yields are however low especially among smallholder farmers who rely on this crop for their livelihood and sustenance. This has rendered most Sub-Saharan Africa countries such as Kenya to be net importers and depended on food aid mainly in form of maize. Even though white maize variety is nutritionally inferior, it is the most produced and consumed with little regard placed on yellow maize. We reviewed 154 articles and reports to highlight challenges facing maize production and sustainable agricultural practices that should be embraced to overcome them, nutritional benefits of yellow maize, factors hindering its consumption and research gaps that need to be addressed to enhance its production and utilization. Key production challenges identified include shrinking land sizes, declining soil fertility, adverse and unpredictable weather patterns and the devastating striga weed. Intercropping especially cereals with legumes have great potential for efficient land, water and nutrient resource utilization, manage weeds and minimize crop failure and adverse weather effects. This combined with integrated soil fertility management will ensure increased yields. It was found that yellow maize has higher carotenoid content hence superior to white maize and when taken with grain legumes provides a low-cost balanced diet. Despite this, yellow maize utilization is low because it is regarded as poor man’s crop, associated with food aid and reserved as livestock feed. This negative perception can be changed through educational campaigns on its nutritional value in order to enhance local production and encourage social acceptability to aid alleviate vitamin A deficiency, a key limiting micronutrient. In conclusion, tapping in the nutritional superiority of yellow maize through legume intercropping should be enhanced for improved food and nutrition security.","Intercropping; Legume; Vitamin A; White Maize; Yellow Maize","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181917267"

In this paper, we evaluate the transformations that occurred in the daily nutritional choices and behaviors of a convenience sample (n = 2288) of Italian residents during the first nation-wide lockdown (March–May 2020) to assess the impact on the health and socio-environmental sustainability of their diets. Results portray a scenario of wide-spread change, especially in relation to the quantity of daily food consumed, the composition of diets and the time and commitment devoted to home-cooking, with young individuals emerging as the most impacted generational cohort. Through the construction of an indicator for healthy–sustainable transition (HST index), we demonstrate that such changes unfold on a gradient, revealing that while for many respondents lockdown nutrition implied overeating and weight gain, a substantial segment of the population conversely improved the healthiness and sustainability of their daily nutritional patterns. In this sense, improvements are associated with young age, socio-economic status, frequency and enjoyment of cooking-from-scratch and, more generally, an attentive attitude towards the quality, provenance and materiality of food that, in turn, the COVID-19 crisis appears to have re-kindled. We conclude by highlighting five areas of institutional intervention (i.e., young people, time, tools, food supply at work, and local food chains) on which to focus in order to ensure the current crisis does not represent a missed opportunity for creating the necessary conditions for sustainable food production and consumption to take hold as the ‘new’ normal in the post-pandemic era.","Covid-19; Food-related Behaviors; Healthy-sustainable Diets; Italy; Lockdown; Nutrition; Covid-19; Dietary Shift; Food Consumption; Health Impact; Nutrition; Public Health; Resident Population; Socioeconomic Conditions; Sustainability; Italy; Indicator Indicator","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106945782"

A concept of water-energy-food nexus (WEF nexus, WEFN) can be used to describe the interaction of constraints or promotion between WEF, as well as the complex internal mechanism in the context of global resource shortage. Previously, water, energy, and food securities have been evaluated separately. Much attention has been gained on the rational use and distribution of WEF nexus, shifting from single to multiple resources in recent years. Therefore, the WEF nexus is widely expected to assess resource management and sustainable development in an integrated manner. It is necessary to simulate the integrated WEF system and accurately evaluate the WEF safety from the perspective of nexus, to ensure the stability and coordination of regional resources, as well as social and economic development. In this study, the synergistic safety of the WEF system was evaluated using the indexes of stability, coordination, and sustainability in Liaoning Province of Northeast China during 2000-2018. A Copula function was applied to calculate the joint risk probability and further analyze the risks of different combinations using symbiosis theory. The results show that there was a relatively low risk probability of the WEF system, while the synergistic safety was gradually improved. Specifically, the joint risk probability of the WEF system was 0.16, and the extremely unsafe probability was 0.06, while the synergistic safety indexes ranged between 0.33 and 0.65 shifting from an unsafe to a safer state. The weightings of stability, coordination, and sustainability indexes of the WEF systems were 0.32, 0.36, and 0.32, respectively, indicating that equal attention needed to be paid to improving the comprehensive security of WEF relationships. A strong correlation was found in the relationship of stability index between the utilization rate of groundwater resources, food production per capita, the rates of development and utilization of water resources, the utilization rate of surface water resources, the rates of renewable energy, as well as the rate of utilization of cultivated land and water consumption per 10, 000 RMB of GDP. A strong correlation was also found in the relationship of coordinated changes between the proportion of energy consumption in the primary industry, the proportion of irrigation water consumption of farmland, and the amount of water use per unit food production. The great correlation to sustainable change was included with the Engel coefficient of urban residents, the Engel coefficient of rural residents, and GDP per capita. In addition, the joint risk probability of S-C, S-E, and C-E were 0.26, 0.17, and 0.18, respectively. The risk of coordination index in the WEF system reached 60%-70%, indicating that the coordination needed to be strengthened. Especially, the implementation was required to make on the agricultural water use efficiency and the transformation of energy consumption patterns, as the stability or sustainability index increased in the WEF system. In future work, a hierarchical early warning can be established to cover the WEF nexus and mutual feeding paths under the ever-evolving environment. Comprehensive response plans can be developed for various types of risks, particularly, the positive impact and reverse feedback of external environmental changes on the synergistic security of WEF nexus, such as climate change and economic situation.","Joint Risk Probability; Liaoning Province; Stability; Synergistic Safety; System; Water-energy-food System; Agricultural Robots; Climate Change; Energy Utilization; Feedback; Groundwater; Irrigation; Risk Perception; Safety Engineering; Surface Water Resources; Surface Waters; Sustainable Development; System Stability; Water Conservation; Water Supply; Agricultural Water Use; Development And Utilizations; Environmental Change; Proportion Of Energy; Resource Management; Social And Economic Development; Strong Correlation; Sustainability Index; Groundwater Resources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108722074"

This will ensure that intermittent nature of these renewable sources and significant variations in demand and supply can be taken care. The novel technologies with innovative solutions need to be incorporated to transform the electrical networks into smarter grids. The role of information and communication technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), energy storage, intelligent control systems, and smart energy meters will be crucial in the development of smart energy systems. These smart energy systems will play vital role in improving renewables’ performance and exploitation with real-time balancing between supply, demand, and storage. Besides, it will also help in energy efficiency, reducing energy waste, peak curtailment using demand-response management, reduction in system’s overall cost, better network control, enhanced performance and reliability of power system with optimal planning of the transmission and distribution systems, and implementation of microgrids with additional distributed generation (DG), etc. In real world, different energy sources and technologies exist, and together fulfills the global energy demand. A smart energy system, therefore, should consider the integration of different energy infrastructure, which may include the production, conversion, storage, and consumption of different energy sources in an intelligent manner. Transportation and storage are going through a revolutionary transformation phase, where a lot of research has been devoted on different aspects to make them an affordable reality. All these lead to new challenges and opportunities, such as charging infrastructure, power quality, frequency response with reducing system inertia, etc. Our current energy system simply cannot map the demands from homes and businesses accurately, and a data-driven approach with smart energy meters may resolve the problem with the use of digital technology to actively monitor the generation and consumptions patterns at root levels. This chapter aims to introduce the concept of smart energy systems (SES). Accordingly, it presents the basic concept of smart grid, issues in integration of renewable energy sources, features of the smart energy systems from the recent literature and challenges ahead in this domain. Finally, it also discusses some models of SES and their relative comparison.","Demand-response Management (drm); Distributed Energy Resources (der); Energy Storage; Renewable Energy Sources (res); Smart Grid","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183364032"

Despite cultivation across the globe, 20 nations account for 90% of all land allocated to sorghum and of those nations, ten account for 80%. Global patterns of plantings and production indicate that both reached lows in the early 1990s but are increasing through 2018. The long-term patterns also show that there is a statistically significant decline in sorghum production in Asia and the Americas and Caribbean while an increase in production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Across the globe, sorghum production has shifted away from Asia, and in particular India, and the United States, toward two separate groups of nations: Those emerging as surplus producers and serving as granaries feeding the international marketplace for industrialized usage and secondly, nations consuming the grain locally, primarily as a foodstuff with local market appeal and trade with neighboring nations. One important factor to the sustainable development of markets and global trade in sorghum is to ensure that multi- and bilateral barriers to trade are not created to limit the flow of sorghum from those nations with a comparative advantage in its production to those nations with demand. The bifurcated usage of sorghum has important implications for technological change. Increased crop productivity, through genetic gain and cost of production savings, will be important as sorghum competes for land that could be occupied by alternative cereals supplying similar physical and chemical products especially in nations with low FSI consumption. By contrast, nations where sorghum is consumed as a human food will require innovation that preserves the value of the grain in environments with highly heterogeneous usage.","Consumption; Production; Sorghum; Trade","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141021346"

Thus, promoting models of sustainable agricultural production that ensure food security, environmental conservation and livelihoods for local populations is needed. In this context, humanity has the great challenge of integrating agriculture, ecosystems, environment and people in the sustainable development scheme, especially with the focus on food systems that maintain a sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Fortunately, there are currently important advances in knowledge and technologies for the management of agrobiodiversity and agricultural crops of great economic and social relevance (i.e. wheat, corn, potatoes, cassava), which will be essential for future scenarios of environmental change. The potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the third most consumed crop that contributes to global food security. The potato continues to be recommended as a key food for human consumption, especially in the face of current population growth, related to problems with food supply, nutrition and food security, and also climate change challenges globally. Understanding how abiotic (i.e., climate, nutrients) and biotic (i.e., pests and diseases) factors and management (i.e., genetic resources, planting) determine production and crop growth patterns has been an important issue in potato crop research. Researchers on potato crops aim to improve agricultural resources management, breeding and seed potato production, post-harvest practices, storage, supply chain, and food security. There are also significant knowledge and technological advances in sustainable potato production systems that have remarkably improved potato yields. This book aims to publish an overview about the current state of the art for sustainable potato production systems and achieving global nutrition and food security targets. The chapters of the book deal mainly with theoretical and practical fundamentals on seed potato production, crop growth and production, postharvest and storage of potato tubers. This integrative and comprehensive review is an important contribution to the knowledge of potato crop management and conservation of potato cultivars in the current context of global climate change, hunger and poverty.","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131034172"

Improving the efficiency of water embedded in rice production and supply could have great implications for food and water security. This study starts from Yunnan, a traditional rice producing and consuming province in southwest China, and analyses its rice supply structure and dynamics, together with embedded water footprints (WFs) of three other regions: Northeast China, South and Southwest China and Southeast Asia. The results show that Yunnan has been through drastic food change in the past decades, leading to an increasing production and supply gap. Yunnan is found to have the least WF (778.2 m3/t) for rice production across the study regions, while Northeast China consumes the highest blue WF (364.6 m3/t) and blue to total WF ratio (97.7%). The study indicates that Northeast China is at risk of groundwater deficit due to rice production and export and the current rice production and consumption pattern is inefficient.

For achieving these goals, various models have been experimented amongst which Circular Economy (CE) is one of the economic models facilitating key policy objectives for generating economic growth and reducing environmental impacts. In economies, cities are focal points of strengthening the transition of linear to a circular economy by smart practices towards a regenerative system. By consuming the assets at their highest utility, there will be an increase in economic resilience of the city and its citizens. The Smart Cities (SCs) and Smart Cities Mission (SCM) of India, Make in India, Digital India, and the Swachh Bharat Mission has potential to integrate CE principles in a pronounced way to pave the way towards a circular transition. To fulfill the SCs objectives, Indian cities have been integrating smart practices (like waste management, e-governance, and smart mobility) with circularity. For the challenges faced by the cities from the design until the implementation phase, circular economy calls for a refit in resource management. These would require policy-level reforms, institutional capacity building, uplifting infrastructure, and financing mechanisms. In India, there is already an existing repair and refurbish culture with strong local traditions integrating the 6Rs. The paper reviews the role of CE in Indian SCM for achieving SDGs by finding opportunities for circular economy and providing recommendations based on them. A matrix has been developed between the ReSOLVE framework and the opportunities of CE in cities.

This issue is particularly pertinent to developed countries, like Australia, who have a high propensity for waste removal arising from their industrial and domestic use of products, materials and organic consumables. Through the use of GIS technology, using modelling software developed by the Global Methane Initiative, a series of simulations were undertaken to determine the viability of an anaerobic digester for the City of Greater Geelong (COGG), located in the State of Victoria (Australia), where organic materials constitute over 25% of all waste land-filled. Using only municipal organic waste, the modelling concluded that the COGG would generate between AU$6M-AU$11M/annum from the sale of biogas/methane. In addition to this revenue stream, COGG would have an Annual Projected Net Emissions Reductions of 3797 Mt. This paper further considers the development of a geospatial database to identify and locate concentrated organic waste resources in COGG, the design and development of a software tool to help quantify the production of food waste, and the development of an economic model to value the organic waste stream of COGG arising from the implementation of this proposal.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104653459"

As water saving by using technologies to alleviate groundwater depletion has its limitations, adjusting the cultivation patterns of water-intensive crops becomes an unavoidable measure to ensure water sustainability. Different cropping patterns (including fallowing) and water supply scenarios were set up, using the DSSAT crop model and a regression model, in order to predict the effects of cropping adjustments on groundwater sustainability and food production in the piedmont region of the plain. The results indicate that: (1) irrigation water requirement needs to be limited to a maximum level of 187 mm/a to sustain groundwater at the present level. Above this level, every 100 mm of irrigation pumping leads to a decline of 0.49 m in the groundwater level; (2) under the current water supply conditions, and taking groundwater sustainability, food supply, water use efficiency and soil fertility recovery into consideration, leaving 34% of the cropland fallow or leaving it fallow every 3 years seems to be the best option; (3) If an extra amount of water of 0.2 or 0.5 billion m3 is supplied as a result of the SNWT Project, the percentage of cropland which should be left fallow can decrease to 25% or 11% respectively.

This “SCP-via-SDGs” approach is a much narrower, specific concept based on historical agreements that range from the Stockholm conference (1972) to the 10-Year Framework of Programmes (10YFP) (2012–2022). Meanwhile, “the academic SCP” is a highly interdisciplinary and complex approach that pursues an answer to what sustainability is, and it has not explicitly provided the SCP-via-SDGs framework at present. Thus, this study proposes a five-by-five framework for the SCP-via-SDGs approach from the production perspective (i.e., for individual firms), following the literature on corporate environmental management. The five stages (I–V) consider environmental management systems (EMS; I. strategy and process) for target 12.4, environmental management accounting (EMA; II. accounting and disclosure) for 12.6, and environmental management control systems (EMCS; III. financial, IV. environmental, and V. overall performance) for 12.2. Meanwhile, the five factors (1–5) consider the baseline and material flow (MF) factors (total waste, hazardous waste, raw materials used, and recycled waste) for targets 12.3 and 12.5. As an application, this study surveyed non-financial listed firms in Vietnam and compared the results to a previous study on Thailand. The results show that the firms are more likely to be at stage III (financial performance of EMCS) in Thailand and stage I or II (EMS or EMA) in Vietnam, suggesting that each market requires its own SCP policies, depending on the economic growth of each.","Environmental Management Accounting; Environmental Management Systems; Sustainable Consumption And Production; Sustainable Development Goals; Thailand And Vietnam; Economics; Environmental Management Systems; Finance; Corporate Environmental Management; Economic Growths; Environmental Management Accountings; Financial Performance; Hazardous Wastes; Management Control System; Sustainable Consumption; United Nations; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091671715"

(2) Affected by many factors such as energy supply side reform, industrialization and urbanization, the growth rate of domestic natural gas consumption is much higher than that of production and the development of natural gas industry still faces a series of problems. (3) It is necessary to strengthen the exploration and development of natural gas to ensure the increase of domestic natural gas storage and production. (4) Diversified import channels should be continuously expanded to disperse the risk of excessive growth of natural gas dependence on foreign countries. (5) The construction of national and dynamic interconnection system and hub should be accelerated.

Given its potential, the household appliance industry is a promising arena for the adoption of Circular Economy. Thus, this study aims to investigate and systematize how Circular Economy has been adopted in the household appliance industry, through a multiple case study research. Twenty cases are analyzed following a Research Framework, to map: (i) the Circular Economy 4R strategies of reduce, reuse, remanufacture and recycle; (ii) the Circular Economy levers, i.e., whether circular product design practices, servitized business models or supply chain management actions are undertaken; (iii) the role of digital 4.0 technologies as enablers; (iv) the benefits achieved. The analysis showed that servitized business models and supply chain management actions are widely used levers, while little attention is devoted to circular product design practices. Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Cloud emerged as powerful enablers of servitized business models. Two main patterns of Circular Economy adoption in the household appliance industry emerged from cases: incremental and radical adoption patterns. Incremental adoption patterns are based on design strategies focused on reduce and recycle, mainly led by manufacturers. Radical adoption patterns are instead focused on disruptive practices based on reuse, remanufacture, servitization and sharing, where digital 4.0 technologies serve as enablers. Overall, this exploratory research lays the foundation for a stronger and more systemic understanding of the adoption of Circular Economy in the household appliance industry.","Case Studies; Circular Benefits; Circular Economy; Household Appliances; Recycle; Reduce; Remanufacture; Reuse; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096067167"

Regional cropland use could be reduced by up to 50%, water demand by up to 65% and combined resource inputs by up to 40% while still supporting adequate nutrition.

It is expected to significantly improve global food security and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Identifying ""hotspots"" from different perspectives of sustainability helps to prioritize the food items for which interventions can lead to the largest reduction of FLW-related impacts. Existing studies in this field have limitations, such as having incomplete geographical and food commodity coverage, using outdated data, and focusing on the mass of FLW instead of its nutrient values. To provide renewed and more informative insights, we conducted a global hotspot analysis concerning FLW with its associated GHG emissions and protein losses using the most recent data (the new FAO Food Balance Sheets updated in 2020). The findings of this research are that there were 1.9 Gt of FLW, 2.5 Gt of associated GHG emissions, and 0.1 Gt of associated protein losses globally in 2017. The results of the FLW amounts, GHG emissions, and protein losses per chain link are given on the scale of the entire world and continental regions. Next to this, food items with relatively high FLW, GHG emissions, and protein losses are highlighted to provide the implications to policymakers for better decision making. For example, fruits and vegetables contribute the most to global FLW volumes, but the product with the highest FLW-associated GHG emissions is bovine meat. For bovine meat, FLW-associated GHG emissions are highest at the consumer stage of North America and Oceania. Oil crops are the major source of protein losses in the global food chain. Another important finding with policy implications is that priorities for FLW reduction vary, dependent on prioritized sustainability criteria (e.g., GHG emissions versus protein losses).","Food Loss And Waste; Ghg Emissions; Global Food Supply Chains; Hotspots; Protein Losses; Food And Agricultural Organization; Food Limitation; Food Quality; Food Security; Food Waste; Greenhouse Gas; Meat; Nutritive Value; Protein; Sustainable Development Goal; North America; Bovinae","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091565786"

In this study, the impacts of production and consumption of the European Union in 2010 were assessed by means of life cycle assessment (LCA)-based indicators and compared with the PBs. Five different perspectives were adopted for assessing the impacts: a production perspective (EU Domestic Footprint) and four distinct consumption perspectives, resulting from alternative modelling approaches including both top-down (input-output LCA) and bottom-up (process-based LCA). Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results were assessed against LCIA-based PBs, which adapted the PBs framework to the LCIA indicators and metrics of the Environmental Footprint method (EF). Global environmental impacts transgressed several LCIA-based PBs. When assessing the overall environmental impacts of EU consumption compared to the global LCIA-based PBs, impacts of EU consumption related to climate change, particulate matter, land use and mineral resources were close or already transgressed the global boundaries. The EU, with less than 10% of the world population, was close to transgress the global ecological limits. Moreover, when downscaling the global PBs and comparing the impacts per capita for an average EU citizen and a global one, the LCIA-PBs were significantly transgressed in many impact categories. The results are affected by uncertainty mainly due to: (a) the intrinsic uncertainties of the different LCA modelling approaches and indicators; (b) the uncertainties in estimating LCIA-based PBs, due to the difficulties in identifying limits for the Earth's processes and referring them to LCIA metrics. The results may anyway be used to define benchmarks and policy targets to ensure that consumption and production in Europe remains within safe ecological boundaries, as well as to understand the magnitude of the effort needed to reduce the impacts.","Absolute Sustainability; Carrying Capacity; Consumption Patterns; Impact Assessment; Life Cycle Assessment Based Indicator; Sustainable Development Goals; Climate Change; Environmental Impact; Land Use; Mineral Resources; Sustainable Development; Uncertainty Analysis; Absolute Sustainability; Carrying Capacity; Consumption Patterns; Impact Assessments; Life Cycle Assessment Based Indicator; Lifecycle Impact Assessment; Modeling Approach; Production And Consumption; Sustainable Development Goal; Uncertainty; Life Cycle; Mineral; Carrying Capacity; Ecological Footprint; Environmental Conditions; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Indicator; Environmental Policy; European Union; Input-output Analysis; Life Cycle Analysis; Productivity; Sustainability; Article; Atmosphere; Benchmarking; Climate Change; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Environmental Aspects And Related Phenomena; Environmental Footprint Method; Environmental Impact; Environmental Sustainability; Eu Citizen; Global Change; Global Climate; Health Impact Assessment; Human; Human Impact (environment); Land Use; Life Cycle Assessment; Natural Resource; Particulate Matter; Planetary Boundary; Population; Socioeconomics; Sustainable Development; Uncertainty; Astronomy; Environmental Protection; Europe; Theoretical Model; Climate Change; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Models, Theoretical; Planets","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085188289"

Considering the extent of public sector demand and how these choices are made, PFP holds considerable potential to influence both food consumption and food production patterns and to deliver multiple social, economic, environmental, nutritional and health benefits to the food system that will contribute to more sustainable diets. Nevertheless, despite the enormous opportunity that PFP offers to drive more sustainable diets, the story of public procurement is often still “a tale of untapped potential”. There are many reasons for this. Among them, there is a lack of a conducive regulatory framework. By taking a multi-disciplinary approach, this paper aims to contribute to the debate on the use of PFP as a policy instrument with potential to contribute to more sustainable diets and food systems. It will do so by bringing to the debate a discussion about the role of the regulatory framework and an analysis of existing legal mechanisms (i.e. preferential procurement schemes) able to translate these policy objectives into adapted and aligned procurement rules. This study builds on existing literature in different disciplines and on three country experiences (Brazil, Paraguay and United States of America). It combines a desk review of relevant literature, reports and case studies on the subject with primary data and expert opinions on some of the country experiences collected mainly through semi-structured interviews.","Food Systems; Public Food Procurement; Regulatory Framework; Sustainable Diets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083555127"

In addition to drivers, the food-related trends were also shaped by numerous environmental (e.g., land/water scarcity), economic, health, and trade challenges. To ensure long-term food and nutrition security for its population, Qatar implemented various policies and strategies (e.g., National Food Security Strategy 2018-2023). In this context, agri-food markets, as functional links between production and consumption, can foster transition towards sustainable food consumption and production patterns in Qatar.","Agricultural Market; Agriculture; Climate Change; Environmental Footprints; Food Import; Food Market; Food Policy; Food Security; Gulf Cooperation Council; Nutrition; Qatar; Agricultural Market; Environmental Economics; Food Chain; Food Consumption; Food Market; Food Security; Income Distribution; Nutritional Status; Population Growth; Strategic Approach; Urbanization; Qatar","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085066098"

It is necessary to strengthen the exploration and development of natural gas to ensure the increase of domestic natural gas storage and production. Diversified import channels should be continuously expanded to disperse the risk of excessive growth of natural gas dependence on foreign countries.

In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim to foster the organizational operationalization and integration of sustainability and, therefore, to address the current and forthcoming stakeholder needs and ensure a better and sustainable future for all, balancing the economic, social, and environmental development. However, it is not entirely clear which are the mutual relationships among the 17 SDGs and this study aims to tackle this research gap. The results of the correlation confirm that Poverty elimination (SDG1) and Good health and well-being (SDG3) have synergetic relationships with most of the other goals. SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) has significant relationships with other SDGs (e.g., SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG13 (Climate action)). However, there is a moderate negative correlation with SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), which emphasizes the need to improve energy efficiency, increase the share of clean and renewable energies and improve sustainable consumption patterns worldwide. There is also confirmation that SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal strongly associated with trade-offs. To sum up, this research suggests that change towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals offers many opportunities for reinforcing rather than inhibiting itself. However, some SDGs show no significant correlation with other SDGs (e.g., SDG13 (Climate action) and SDG17 (Partnerships for the goals), which highlights the need for future research.","Correlation; Relationships; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Synergies; Trade-offs; Integrated Approach; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Trade-off; United Nations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085073978"

The chemical footprint for mercury and its compounds was taken as an example to study. These chemicals belong to priority pollutants and their ever-increasing amounts in the environment have caused concern around the world, which is reflected in the adoption of the Minamata Convention. The Minamata Convention aims to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic releases of mercury and mercury compounds. This Convention is an important component of efforts to achieve sustainable, inclusive and resilient human development through SDGs, which were adopted in September 2015 and especially SDG Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Relevancy of this work is due to the need for the adopting of a series of measures to withdraw some mercury-containing goods from the production cycle. Also, one of the most important statements of the Convention is in reference to the issue of mercury contamination when recycling mercury. An important aspect of the work described in this paper is the reduction of mercury pollution from mercury-containing waste products by the development of technology in accordance with the principles of green chemistry. These are energy-efficient and without waste -water discharge technology. The main result of this work is the fundamental research for a transformation of elemental mercury and its compounds into less dangerous forms for the human body and the environment, providing a guaranteed absence of mercury-containing waste in the atmosphere and water systems. Various conditions for reaction of the immobilization of metallic mercury in mercury-containing wastes were investigated and it was established that it proceeded best under the following conditions: Reaction of metallic mercury with elementary sulfur; A ball mill is used as a reactor, which ensures constant updating of the contact area of the phases; For a good dispersion of mercury and for a relatively quick and complete reaction a large excess of sulfur up to 6500 % by stoichiometry (e.g. ratio of mercury:sulfur = 1:1.5 by weight) is necessary; The addition of a very small amount of water also has a positive effect (hydromodulus of Solid:Liquid = 3:1 by weight).","Chemical Footprint; Icgc-8; Immobilization Mercury In Waste; Mercury Sulphide; Mercury-containing Waste (mcw); Principles Of Green Chemistry; Usetox; Energy Efficiency; Pollution; Sulfur; Sulfur Compounds; Sustainable Development; Waste Disposal; Fundamental Research; Green Chemistry; Icgc-8; Mercury Contamination; Production Patterns; Sustainable Consumption; Usetox; Wastewater Discharge; Mercury Compounds","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074765729"

Demonstrating that unconventional energy production methods are much less efficient, more carbon intensive, more environmentally destructive and just as unsustainable, and that renewable energy relies on the extraction of nonrenewable natural resources such as lithium that result in similar environmental and social issues, this chapter will interrogate this and ask the question - is the capitalist system in its current form capable of making ‘sustainable development something more than the oxymoron it appears?'.","Capitalism; Extreme Energy; Lithium Mining; Renewable Energy; Sdgs; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122836263"

The aim of the research was studying of the regional aspect of municipal waste management disparities in Bulgaria. The progress for achievement of the Bulgaria's national targets was analyzed for 4-years period from 2015 to 2018. The objects of study were the regions at LAU 1 (Local Administrative Units) level, according the European Union legislation. The regions with problems in municipal waste management were identified. The number of municipalities in Bulgaria with recycling rate less than 1% in 2015 year was 90 (34.1% of municipalities) and in 2018 year was 67 (25.3% of municipalities). The correlation between the recycling rate at local level and key economic indicators such as the number of enterprises, gross value added, turnover and etc. were analyzed. The analysis showed weak positive correlations for 2018 year at local level between: the number of enterprises and the recycling rate (0.216); the turnover and the recycling rate (0.194); the output and the recycling rate (0.204); the gross value added ant the recycling rate (0.196). The identified disparities at regional level in the municipal waste management are a base for studying of good management practices and their implementation in problem regions.

The depletion of natural resources, the deterioration of environmental quality as well as the degradation of ecosystems and human health lead to a reconsideration of public production and consumption patterns. More attention is paid nowadays to the production and consumption of biomass-based products. Biomass represents a sustainable alternative to oil products, allowing us to obtain a wide range of different commodities and to guarantee environmental, social and economic benefits. However, in order to ensure really sustainable production and consumption, it is not enough to produce goods from biomass instead of oil. It is necessary to ensure sustainable management, starting with the choice of the sustainable biorefinery location, passing through the value and supply chains, which must guarantee minimum waste and environmental emissions, and finishing with sustainable consumption of goods. This article discusses the choice of an optimal sustainable biorefinery location, while taking into account the environmental and socio-economic characteristics of a territory. Several zones of one French region were considered for this investigation. Each zone was studied in terms of its ecological (access to water resources, …) and socio-economic (unemployment rate, …) aspects. The results of our study demonstrate which aspects are the most important when choosing the optimal sustainable location, and which of the studied zones is most suitable for the biorefinery sustainable anchoring.","Biorefinery; Environment; Sustainable Development; Territory","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073239304"

Against the backdrop of a complex problem that requires a comprehensive and systemic solution, it is to ensure sustainable parameters of economic growth. As the economy has a tendency to repeat the dynamics, it allows us to identify the cyclical nature of its development. Successful industrial development is replaced by periods of decline, accompanied by inflation and unemployment, a decline in production and consumption. The study of socio-economic dynamics in a long-term retrospective allows us to identify patterns in development and develop a set of anti-crisis measures. In this work, the dynamics of socio-economic processes that accompany the development of the national economic complex in recent years has been studied. Analysis of the dynamics of the GDP of the Russian Federation made it possible to discover the cyclical nature of its development. From 2002 to 2015, two cycles were identified: The first from 2002 to 2008; the second - from 2009 to 2015. After the global financial and economic crisis of 2008–2009, Russia noted the post-crisis economic recovery, which was interrupted in 2013–2014 by the introduction of international economic sanctions against Russia. The slowdown in economic growth since 2014 was determined by external shocks in the energy and raw materials markets, as well as geopolitical tensions and, as a consequence, the closure of foreign capital markets for a number of Russian companies and banks. Analysis of investment as the main catalyst for economic growth showed a fall in investment volumes amid the effects of the crises of 2008 and 2013–2015. A decrease in investment activity in the regional structure of investments was noted. The modern tendencies in reorientation of regional investments in the branch, not subject to sanctions influence and working on realization of import substitution policy are revealed. Groups of activities aimed at stimulating capital investments and ensuring sustainable economic development in the regions have been formed.","Economic Growth; Innovation; Innovation Development; Innovation Management; Investment","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070565542"

As reports show, some advances have been made, although these are not sufficient to counter the challenges of global environmental, socio-economic and humanitarian crises. Transitioning toward sustainable development requires simultaneous progress in all 17 SDGs. These goals represent a comprehensive framework made up of interconnected, indivisible aspects, revealing the multidimensional nature of the task. This article focuses on SDG 12, the goal that aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production. Tackling the current patterns of consumption and production is crucial for sustainability because these are the main drivers of serious environmental and social impacts. Taking the European Union’s conceptualisation of the circular economy as a reference, the article makes inroads into the transformation required to achieve this goal and interlinks it to the other 16 SDGs. Drawing on the Spanish Voluntary Report presented in 2018, the study shows the limitations in assessing progress with the tools available. Though we cannot generalise, the example of Spain provides insights of global interest. Achieving SDG 12 involves major transformations, including industrial processes and society as a whole. Evidently, this represents a huge challenge, as well as a great opportunity to foster sustainable development for policy-makers and stakeholders.

In the next 2 years, the supply of pork will be tight for the quick significant decreasing of breeding sows inventory, especially in South China for the African swine fever and the pork outputs in 2019 and 2020 are predicted to decrease by about 20% and 22%-25%, respectively. The price of live pig will enter a new round of rising cycle quickly and reach the climax in the third quarter of next year. Thus, the net income will be at a good level for 3 consecutive years. In short term, the oversupply and tight supply of pork in production and consumption area showed alternatively and the live pig price in different provinces showed the same rising trend after significant different price trends of rising and decreasing. Profound changes have taken place in the distribution of pig production and slaughter, circulation pattern, consumption structure, pork trade and price cycle in long term. For regionalization control policy of the African swine fever, the pig industry in Northeast and Southwest of China will be vertically integrated, and the slaughtering capacity will be transferred from the sales area to the production area and optimized. Pork consumption habit will have to be adjusted to fresh chilled meat for the pig products transportation across provinces have to change from live pig to pork. The ratio of pork among the total meat consumption decreased from 62.7% in 2018 to 50%-55% in 2020 for the replacement of poultry meat. For the gap of pork supply and demand, as well as the price rising, China's pork import is predicted to reach 2 and 3 million tons in 2019 and 2020, respectively and in the future will maintain higher level even after the pig production capability recovery. The recovery of pig inventory will be slowed down for low breeding sows inventory, high disease risk and lacking of vaccine. To ensure the stability of the pork market and efficient implementation of regionalization control policy of ASF, the top-level design and legislation of regionalization control should be strengthened as well as the community veterinary system in rural areas and the subsidizing mechanism of mandatory culling pigs should be optimized and thus the risk of disease transmission could be reduced by the joint prevention among the government, enterprise and pig farmer, to promote the sustainable development of the pig industry.","African Swine Fever; Marketing; Meat; Pig Industry; Pig Price Cycle; Pork Consumption; Pork Imports; Pork Transportation; Commerce; Disease Control; Environmental Protection; Mammals; Marketing; Sustainable Development; African Swine Fever; Pig Industry; Pork Consumption; Pork Imports; Price Cycle; Meats","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074706480"

The provision of food for airline passengers demonstrates an unsustainable consumption and production pattern and food waste from flight catering poses a significant sustainability issue, not only because valuable caloric content is lost, but also the loss of land, water and energy required in the production of food. A conduct of literature review of food waste management in airline catering business revealed a lack of research in this area. Through a case study of Halal food production process, the research aims to identify the amount of food waste generated from Halal kitchen flight catering production process in order to identify food waste hotspots by conducting a food waste composition analysis, Material Flow Analysis and eco-efficiency analysis. It also endeavors to provide insights that can help organizations better understand the food waste generation and composition imperative to the establishment of food waste management policies and make informed decisions to ensure that the future growth is more sustainable. One of the goals of this research is to develop a recommendation for sustainable food waste management by promoting the most preferred approaches of sustainable food waste management, which can prevent and reduce food wastage at source instead of the least preferred approach, which is recovering energy before landfill disposal. This research found that vegetable wastes accounted for 40–50 percent of the total food generated in the operation. From the quantitative analyses, it is recommended that the company prioritize its efforts in reducing seafood waste due to relatively high impact the reduction in seafood wastes will have in terms of cost-savings potential. This can be achieved by designing menus and recipes that aim to utilize seafood efficiently in combination with starting a dialogue with airline customers on the benefits of food waste reduction. The material flow diagram clearly illustrates the hotspots in the halal production process. Although the meal portioning process did not generate the highest amount of food waste, but in terms of edibility, this process generated the highest amount of wasted food (edible parts). Measures should be established in order to address the inefficiencies in the resource use. The company can reduce vegetables waste by selecting high quality suppliers, improve the effectiveness of selection and quality control process by providing additional training, changing the washing process and investing in new technology that facilitate staff in their jobs.","Eco-efficiency; Flight Catering; Food Waste; Halal Food Production; Material Flow Analysis; Sustainable Waste Management; Air Transportation; Meats; Personnel Training; Public Utilities; Quality Control; Vegetables; Eco-efficiency; Flight Catering; Food Production; Food Waste; Material Flow Analysis; Sustainable Waste Management; Waste Disposal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065505081"

A Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. The government in a nation strives efforts to reduce the amount of the wasted edible food to achieve the SDG target. This paper examines edible food loss at the stage of vegetable production in Japan. Vegetables are not delivered to a market, but are instead discarded in the field. As described herein, we identify the amount of food loss at the regional level in Japan, and elucidate relations between production and consumption by examining multi-regional trading within Japan. Using a footprint analysis particularly addressing vegetables that are discarded in fields, we identify where food loss occurs and where agricultural products that are discarded in fields are presumed to be delivered and consumed. Clarifying the linkage of the food loss from production sites to intended consumers by prefecture helps farmers to make a crop production and distribution plan and to cooperate with other farmers to reduce annual food losses. Our food loss footprint analysis can provide opportunities for consumers to realize their own responsibilities and to raise awareness about food loss. Furthermore, it identifies environmental burdens by producing the crops discarded in a field. The findings from our analysis can facilitate producer-consumer communication to avoid overproduction and to highlight alternative destinations for overproduced agricultural products to markets with a shortage of agricultural crops.","Agricultural Crops; Consumers’ Responsibility; Field Disposal; Food Loss; Footprint Analysis; Multi-regional Input Output; Supply Chain; Vegetables; Commerce; Cultivation; Food Supply; Supply Chains; Sustainable Development; Vegetables; Agricultural Crops; Environmental Burdens; Food Loss; Footprint Analysis; Input-output; Production And Consumption; Sustainable Consumption; Vegetable Productions; Crops; Agricultural Market; Consumption Behavior; Crop Production; Food Market; Food Supply; Food Waste; Sustainable Development; Vegetable; Article; Awareness; Consumer; Crop; Gene Overexpression; Human; Japan; Market; Nonhuman; Responsibility","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063964583"

Indonesia, the world's largest oil palm producer, has leased large tracts of forested and tribal lands as new concessions, thereby expanding oil palm plantations. While previous studies have focused on some of the important social and environmental consequences of this process, the full suite of potential environmental impacts from land conversion and cultivation remains poorly understood. Here we quantify these impacts in terms of forest loss and fragmentation, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from land use change, and freshwater pollution from fertilizer application. Within all concession types, forest cover decreased by 20% and forest fragmentation increased by 44%, both of which are significantly higher than in comparable non-concession areas. We also assess to what extent CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and freshwater pollution are attributable to increasing palm oil demand abroad. We find that four-fifths of Indonesia's palm oil production is for export markets and that 66% of this is destined for just eight countries – India, China, Pakistan, Malaysia, Italy, Egypt, Bangladesh, and the United Kingdom. Examining these multiple impacts highlights the importance of remote policies and consumption patterns in dictating local production decisions in a telecoupled world. This work demonstrates that - in order to be truly sustainable - bioenergy initiatives must ensure that adverse environmental impacts (and the demands that drive them) are reduced globally and not simply displaced elsewhere.","Biofuel; Deforestation; Fragmentation; Globalization; Indonesia; Oil Palm; Rainforest; Telecoupling; Water Scarcity, Co2 Emissions; Biofuels; Carbon Dioxide; Cultivation; Land Use; Palm Oil; Pollution; Water; Co2 Emissions; Fragmentation; Globalisation; Indonesia; Oil Palm; Oil-production; Rainfor; Telecoupling; Water Scarcity; Water Scarcity, Co2 Emission; Deforestation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062157118"

To save energy and ensure the economic benefits of industrial production, we designed a reallocation planning model for urban industrial land. The planning model takes the cost of industrial land development, the investment intensity of unit land fixed assets and planning density as the main planning indices and combines the tax differences for different energy consumption intensity industries and the heterogeneity of the enterprise's decision of spatial location. The reallocation strategy of the model is simulated according to the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations of China. The characteristics of industrial land reallocation planning and its impact on industrial structure optimization and emission reduction are analyzed. The results show that the position adjustment of industrial parks during planning will lead to ladder-type spatial characteristics of planning indices through enterprises’ decision heterogeneity. The differences in tax intensity for industries with different energy consumption intensities have little influence on indices’ spatial characteristics and have no significant impact on the structural characteristics of the industrial land development cost except for large size enterprises. The role of urban industrial land reallocation planning in the process of urban industrial structure optimization has been better reflected under indifferent tax policies, which will also have a significant effect on reducing regional industrial carbon emissions and optimizing the spatial pattern of regional industrial carbon emissions. In China's Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations, cities with large areas of industrial land should make full use of the role of the industrial park's position adjustment in urban industrial land reallocation planning to optimize the urban industrial structure. Cities with small scale industrial land should pay attention to the decision heterogeneity of enterprises in the planning process. Industrial tax policy and land use planning should be combined to make full use of the contribution of industrial land reallocation to regional carbon emission reduction.","Carbon Emission; Industrial Land Development Cost; Industrial Land Reallocation; Industrial Layout Adjustment; Structure Optimization; Agglomeration; Carbon Emission; Emission Control; Industrial Development; Land Use Planning; Manufacturing; Optimization; Sustainable Development; Urban Planning; China; Yangtze Delta","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057129571"

New waves of technological innovations have led to differentiation in industrial production and consumption patterns, which then resulted in more intensive use of natural resources, chemicals, and accumulation of more waste than in the past. Hence, sustainability of environment and natural resources is becoming an increasingly important and challenging issue in such a world. Many environmentally sound approaches such as green growth/economy, circular economy, and sustainable consumption and production (SCP) have been evolving in the context of sustainable development to decrease the pressures of industry on environment and natural resources. Multilateral environmental agreements and the ""2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” are strongly supporting these approaches. For instance, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 12 of the 2030 Agenda advise countries to ensure sustainable industrialization and SCP patterns.

According to FAO (Food wastage footprint: impacts on natural resources: summary report. FAO, Rome, 2013) the global carbon footprint (CF) of annual food wastage is about 3.3 Gt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<inf>2</inf>e). This fact is altering the sustainability of the food supply chain. Although retailers as part of the food supply chain do not generate as much food waste as other stages, the food management at the retailers’ stage is deeply encompassed. Their influence as the nexus amongst producers and consumers play a key role on the amount of food wasted throughout the supply chain. Therefore, the retail sector’s strategies to reduce food wastage seem to be essential in order to pursue a sustainable economy and to combat climate change. Moreover, it is also aligned to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 12 from the United Nations “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” that establishes an objective that “by 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains”. In this scenario, one of the best practices of Walmart Inc. is the Project Gigaton. The objective of this project is to avoid the generation of one billion CO<inf>2</inf> tons throughout the Walmart’ supply chain. In order to demonstrate best practices and to lead its suppliers towards CO<inf>2</inf> reduction initiatives, Walmart Mexico as one of the main markets of the company is implementing the “Zero Waste” (ZW) strategy on its operations. The ZW strategy at Walmart is aimed to manage efficiently any type of waste and also to consider the potential carbon footprint reduction due to a proper food waste management. Hence, this research sought to explore the potential of the carbon footprint reduction through different alternative food waste management routes aimed to lessen even further Walmart Mexico’s environmental footprint. Consequently, in this chapter, the carbon footprint emissions were calculated based on each final destination, which includes: food donations to food banks, animal feeding, bio-digestion and composting. The findings of this analysis showed that every final destination had a reduction of the carbon footprint from food waste avoidance, which would help to support the development and actions needed to amplify the benefits of the ZW strategy in a broader scope and to contribute to the SDG.","Carbon Footprint; Greenhouse Emissions Reduction; Retailer; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Production And Consumption; Zero Food Waste","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089848850"

One of these goals has direct implication for the industrial sector - ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. In a world where globalization is more and more present, packaging emerges as a link between all points around the world, allowing transporting and commercializing products on a global level, from producers to consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to study how the packaging industry is adapting itself to the increasing demands of the markets, while complying with the global environmental requirements and sustainable goals established by international organizations. Accordingly, this paper aims to analyse precisely this industry, intending to understand how the theme of Ecodesign and sustainability are faced by packaging manufacturers, and what are the key-factors associated to the success of their implementation in the companies. Characterization of the industry is also presented, defining how companies should organize and prepare themselves in order to have a diminishing environmental impact, a raw-materials sustainability policy and consider environmental aspects through the packaging's life cycle - Eco-design.","Eco-design; Environment; Industry; Manufacturers; Packaging; Sustainability","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083534212"

We show how the targets and indicators emerged in debates between national governments, UN agencies, civil society and private sector organizations – and how they reflect both the political process and technical and practical considerations in translation of a broad concept into the SDG format. While the emergence of SDG 12 as a standalone goal stems from a push by developing countries to build pressure on developed countries, and its presence may open space for attention to this area in the future, many of its targets were watered down and left vague. The indicators to measure progress on the targets further narrow the scope and ambition of Goal 12, whose current content does not adequately reflect earlier more transformative conceptualizations of Sustainable Consumption and Production.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060763509"

In this paper, we analyse SDG 12, which aims to “ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” Despite long-standing political recognition of this objective, and ample scientific evidence both on its importance and on the efficacy of various ways of promoting it, the SDGs do not provide clear goals or effective guidance on how to accomplish this urgently needed transformation. Drawing from the growing body of research on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), the paper identifies two dominant vantage points—one focused on promoting more efficient production methods and products (mainly through technological improvement and informed consumer choice) and the other stressing the need to consider also overall volumes of consumption, distributional issues, and related social and institutional changes. We label these two approaches efficiency and systemic. Research shows that while the efficiency approach contains essential elements of a transition to sustainability, it is by itself highly unlikely to bring about sustainable outcomes. Concomitantly, research also finds that volumes of consumption and production are closely associated with environmental impacts, indicating a need to curtail these volumes in ways that safeguard social sustainability, which is unlikely to be possible without a restructuring of existing socioeconomic arrangements. Analysing how these two perspectives are reflected in the SDGs framework, we find that in its current conception, it mainly relies on the efficiency approach. On the basis of this assessment, we conclude that the SDGs represent a partial and inadequate conceptualisation of SCP which will hamper implementation. Based on this determination, this paper provides some suggestions on how governments and other actors involved in SDGs operationalisation could more effectively pursue SCP from a systemic standpoint and use the transformation of systems of consumption and production as a lever for achieving multiple sustainability objectives.","Public Policy; Sdg Implementation; Sustainable Consumption And Production; Systemic Approaches","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047393852"

The ecological tension index (ETI) was introduced to quantitatively evaluate the regional ecological security and its changing trend was forecasted by using GM (1, 1) model. The results show that: The ecological footprint of the Yarkant river plain oasis increased in the past 25 years with an average annual growth rate of 15. 45%. The ecological capacity showed a decreasing trend in general. Regional production and consumption were still in the mode of sustainable development while the ecological surplus decreased from 18 969. 45x103 to 5 636. 25x103 hm2, with reduction rate of 70. 29%.

There were great differences among counties in ecological security. In 2016, as an example, ecological security of Zepu and Yecheng Counties was extremely unsafe but Bachu County was in a very safe state. According to the predicting results of GM (1, 1), in the next 30 years, EF will increase and EC will decrease and ecological surplus will turn into ecological deficit. By 2048, regional ecological security will deteriorate to extremely unsafe. It is suggested that the production activities of Yarkant river plain oasis should be focused on the protection of the aquatic ecosystem, curb of excessive consumption of grassland and cultivated land, so as to ensure the sustainable development of regional production and consumption.","Ecological Footprint; Ecological Security; Ecosystem Service Value; Yarkant River Plain Oasis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054529449"

It is the case that while cities demonstrate an ever-growing pattern of energy consumption, rural areas keep themselves as almost low-density territories and with the greatest potential of renewable energy sources. This means a new smart specialization of rural areas as green energy exporters to fuel urban areas, providing effective and long-lasting answers to the climate change, the reduction of energy dependency and respective social, economic and environmental impacts. Nevertheless, the implementation of renewable energy sources requires safeguarding the balance between occupation and land use and, at the same time, preservation and respect for the environmental, cultural and scenic values of these privileged territories. The present paper describes the first stage of an exploratory empirical study on the various impacts caused by the implementation of different renewable energy sources in rural areas. With reference to the County of Loures in Portugal, factors and geographical determinants, underlying the localization of recently implemented photovoltaic power plants and wind farms, have been identified. The level 5 Corine Land Cover 2007 datasets and satellite images have been used along with the information collected during on-site field work. The delimitation of infrastructure areas associated with renewable energy production, has enabled an understanding of the changes in land occupation over the time period of a decade and how these aspects are linked to the spatial dimensions of planning and land management. The results obtained demonstrate the emergence of a functional dichotomy between the preservation of lands with strong agricultural potential and the massive expansion of renewable energy production across rural areas. This allows us to understand how the implementation of renewable energy sources is ever more linked to the local decision-making process associated with spatial planning. The role that municipalities can play in the definition of strategies to ensure an efficient, balanced and sustainable renewable energy zoning in rural areas will therefore be crucial.","Corine Land Cover 2007; Municipal Energy Planning; Photovoltaic Power Plants; Renewable Energy Sources; Rural Areas; Wind Farms; Climate Change; Decision Making; Electric Utilities; Employment; Energy Policy; Energy Utilization; Environmental Impact; Land Use; Urban Planning; Wind Power; Corine Land Cover; Corine Land Cover 2007; Energy Planning; Energy Productions; Municipal Energy Planning; Photovoltaic Power Plant; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Development; Renewable Energy Source; Wind Farm; Rural Areas; Alternative Energy; Data Set; Decision Making; Energy Planning; Energy Resource; Energy Use; Land Cover; Land Management; Land Use; Occupation; Photovoltaic System; Power Generation; Power Plant; Resource Development; Rural Area; Satellite Imagery; Wind Farm; Lisboa [portugal]; Loures; Portugal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048482085"

The study was focused on the documentation of traditional knowledge about samardala, covering local collection and cultivation practices, processing methods and consumption preferences. The respondents (aged 30–86 years, 50% over 65) were local producers and small-scale salesmen of the herbage and samardala-containing spices. To assess the health features of samardala spices the total phenol and flavonoid content was measured in home-consumed or marketed flavoured salts. Overall appreciation of the plant and related food products was found to be very high; presenting a considerable engagement of the locals in plant cultivation and gathering, laborious processing and consumption. Traditional ecological knowledge about the biology, phenology and ecology of the samardala plant and methods for its processing is still preserved by elderly people who rely mostly on their own cultivated plants.

Modernization of the processing method has not affected the quality of the products and faster processing could be a contributing factor for the higher content of biologically active substances. Phenolic content was about twice as low as the flavonoid content, following the same pattern for all tested flavoured salts. Measures for better management of natural populations and promotion of cultivation practices of A. siculum subsp. dioscoridis would ensure the sustainable quality of traditional products as well as conservation of the natural plant resources.","Ethnobotany; Flavonoids; Flavoured Salt; Nectaroscordum Siculum; Phenols; Alternative Agriculture; Cultivation; Dicotyledon; Ethnobotany; Natural Resource; Perennial Plant; Phenol; Salt; Secondary Metabolite; Traditional Knowledge; Bulgaria; Allium Siculum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042924788"

However, since the demand for finite resources continues to increase, the sustainability of current production and consumption patterns is questioned both in developed and developing countries. A transition towards an economy based on biotic renewable resources (bio-economy) is considered necessary in order to support a steady provision of resources, representing an alternative to an economy based on fossil and abiotic resources. However, to ensure a sustainable use of biotic resources, there is the need of properly accounting for their use along supply chains as well as defining a robust and comprehensive impact assessment model. Since so far naturally occurring biotic resources have gained little attention in impact assessment methods, such as life cycle assessment, the aim of this study is to enable the inclusion of biotic resources in the assessment of products and supply chains. This paper puts forward a framework for biotic resources assessment, including: i) the definition of system boundaries between ecosphere and technosphere, namely between naturally occurring and man-made biotic resources; ii) a list of naturally occurring biotic resources which have a commercial value, as basis for building life cycle inventories (NOBR, e.g. wild animals, plants etc); iii) an impact pathway to identify potential impacts on both resource provision and ecosystem quality; iv) a renewability-based indicator (NOBRri) for the impact assessment of naturally occurring biotic resources, including a list of associated characterization factors. The study, building on a solid review of literature and of available statistical data, highlights and discusses the critical aspects and paradoxes related to biotic resource inclusion in LCA: from the system boundaries definition up to the resource characterization.","Biotic Resources; Carrying Capacity; Impact Assessment; Indicators; Life Cycle Assessment; Renewability; Developing Countries; Ecology; Economics; Electric Current Carrying Capacity (cables); Indicators (instruments); Supply Chain Management; Biotic Resources; Building Life Cycle; Characterization Factors; Impact Assessments; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Renewability; Resource Characterizations; Sustainable Supply Chains; Life Cycle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038841000"

However, the potential value of distributed generation and demand flexibility has not yet been fully realized in the operation of MGs. This study investigates the pricing and operation strategy with DR for a MG retailer in an integrated energy system (IES). Based on co-optimizing retail rates and MG dispatch formulated as a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, our model devises a dynamic pricing scheme that reflects the cost of generation and promotes DR, in tandem with an optimal dispatch plan that exploits spark spread and facilitates the integration of renewables, resulting in improved retailer profits and system stability. Main issues like integrated energy coupling and customer bill reduction are addressed during pricing to ensure rates competitiveness and customer protection. By evaluating on real datasets, the system is demonstrated to optimally coordinate storage, renewables, and combined heat and power (CHP), reduce carbon dioxide emission while maintaining profits, and effectively alleviate the PV curtailment problem. The model can be used by retailers and MG operators to optimize their operations, as well as regulators to design new utility rates in support of the ongoing transformation of energy systems.","Demand Response; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy Pricing; Microgrid; Rate Design; Unit Commitment; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Costs; Energy Resources; Global Warming; Integer Programming; Profitability; Quadratic Programming; Renewable Energy Resources; Sustainable Development; System Stability; Demand Response; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy Pricing; Micro Grid; Unit-commitment; Sales; Combined Heat And Power; Competitiveness; Demand Analysis; Ecosystem Resilience; Energy Market; Numerical Model; Optimization; Photovoltaic System; Power Generation; Price Dynamics; Renewable Resource; Smart Grid","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020198061"

Bangladesh has a high potential for perishable vegetable production, which can only be sustainable by using cold storage facilities, which are not available in many locations because of the limitations of the fossil fuel-powered national electricity grid. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the economic and technical feasibility of solar-biomass hybrid cold storage, using renewable energy sources, to prevent the loss of potatoes at the farm level. This study mainly focused on a 20 MT cold storage facility, and has two main objectives: to determine whether the hybrid-cooling model is technically and economically feasible and to address the potential scope for its implementation in rural off-grid areas where no grid connection is expected within the next 15 years. In order to fulfil the objectives of the feasibility study, field and company visits were undertaken and data collected in Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands. The study was mostly qualitative in nature and utilized standard data collection techniques. Three renewable energy models are discussed in the paper: (1) the solar based model, (2) the biomass-based model and (3) the solar-biomass hybrid model. All three models are expected to have a significantly negative net present value (NPV), mainly due to the large investment costs. This implies that the economic feasibility will rely strongly on subsidies from governments or other organizations. The hybrid model will require a larger investment outlay due to the additional components, but there are significant cost reduction opportunities once the model is standardized and commercialized. Each model is viable in Bangladesh when appropriate use is made of potential revenue streams from byproducts such as silica, ash and excess electricity. However, several issues need consideration such as choosing appropriate location and technology, and expert opinion is needed during the design and implementation phase.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060455479"

The production is for both domestic and export which contribute towards country's income and economic growth. Despite the significant contribution to the economy, being one of the plantation sectors, Malaysian palm oil has been criticized by the western communities for causing environmental problems such as deforestation and open burning. Hence, it is important for the palm oil companies to ensure sustainable operation and production. The introduction of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) or sustainability certification, for instance, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO), encourages the sustainable practices by the industry players. Recently, the government had announced the mandatory MSPO-certification in Malaysia by end of 2019. At present, there are only 43.6% Malaysian palm oil companies with at least one certification. The mandatory certification had raised concern among companies on additional costs of adoption which eventually will affect profitability. Moreover, sustainability certifications will only benefit the exporting companies for international market penetration. The question is how important does this certification to the exporting companies as compared to others? This study will analyse the effect of sustainability certification on operational profitability of Malaysian palm oil exporting companies. This study employs generalised least square (GLS) estimation on 17 listed palm oil companies in Bursa Malaysia from 2009 to 2015. The result shows that there is no significant difference in operating profitability due to sustainability certification between the palm oil exporting than the non-exporting companies. The findings indicate that sustainablity practice through RSPO or/and MSPO motivates Malaysian palm oil companies to produce certified palm oil for international and domestic markets, which in line with sustainable development goal (SDG) no. 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns) by the United Nations (UN).","Mspo; Performance; Rspo; Sdgs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057478849"

From the Industrial Revolution to the present, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by about 30% (IPCC in Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. 2016), and these environmental changes have led to significant climate change effects, such as rising temperatures, water shortages, soil loss and the ‘intensification of the process of desertification. Western societies are characterized by high energy consumption and, with the population growth and economic growth in emerging countries, the effects will tend to be increase more and more. Current patterns of production and consumption have proven unsustainable, and we need radical changes to escape this vicious circle affecting humanity. But, it is necessary first of all to realize that constant economic growth and the indiscriminate us of the energy sector are physically impossible on a planet of finite size and limited resources. In the encyclical, Laudato Si’, Pope Francis fully embraced the message of environmental economists defining the environment as a “good that the market mechanisms are not able to defend” (paragraph 190). The Pope appears to be in tune with what has been stated by the scientific literature about the possible roads to take to resolve the problem: “the consumption of fossil fuels must decrease without delay” (165), simultaneously, “the transition from the use thereof to renewable energy sources should not be hindered, but accelerated “(26). It is necessary to adopt a circular pattern of production to ensure resources for everyone by using, in particular, renewable energy progressively, thus reducing dependency on fossil fuels. In this sense, the agricultural world, thanks to renewable resources and the adoption of advanced practices such as anaerobic digestion, could play a role of fundamental importance to an economy based on sustainable use of resources and circularity. The chain of biogas, in fact, is based on a natural biological process which, starting from the residues of agricultural activities, can produce electricity, heat or biomethane, in addition to the digestate, a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion process, which can be used in agriculture to improve soil fertility through the continuous recycling of organic substances. This paper aims to show how the creation of an anaerobic digestion plant on a farm might be the answer for the attainment of an advanced agricultural model, competitive and sustainable, both in environmental and economic-tale: the perfect example of a circular economy.","Anaerobic Digestion; Biogas; Circular Economy; Digestat; Increase Of Soil Fertility Back To Earth; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Atmospheric Chemistry; Biogas; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Dioxide Process; Climate Change; Economics; Energy Policy; Energy Utilization; Fossil Fuels; Nitrogen Oxides; Population Statistics; Renewable Energy Resources; Soils; Sustainable Development; Anaerobic Digestion Process; Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide; Atmospheric Concentration; Circular Economy; Digestat; Production And Consumption; Renewable Energy Source; Soil Fertility; Anaerobic Digestion","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051856825"

The concepts of virtual water content (VWC) and water footprint (WF) are increasingly being used to analyse the water consumption and to support optimal crop and water management practices at different spatial scales. In the present study, the blue, green and grey VWC of crops and WF of crop production within the Gomti river basin (GRB) in India were assessed for irrigated and rainfed conditions. Total WF is the sum of blue, green and grey WFs within the basin. Blue WF is the amount of surface or groundwater used in crop evapotranspiration (ETc), green WF refers to amount of rain water use in ETc, and the grey water use is the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the agricultural pollutant load to acceptable levels. On the basis of variability in ETc, the GRB was divided into four spatial resolution units (SRUs). A linear programming model was developed to optimize the area under each crop in different SRUs with the objective function of minimizing the blue WF within the GRB. The findings show that annual WF of crop production within the GRB was 12,196 Mm3, of which 89% was from irrigated agriculture. Wheat, paddy and sugarcane shared 94% of the total WF of crop production within the basin. Share of blue and green WFs in total WF of the basin was 48 and 46%, respectively. There was considerable variation in VWC of crops in different SRUs. The VWC-based optimal allocation of crops would result in savings of 196 Mm3 in blue WF per year. Considering the large WF of crop production, optimizing the crop planting pattern is the key to achieve more sustainable water use within the basin. The approach suggested in this study will be useful in devising informed policy decisions related to crop choices and their cultivation areas so as to ensure efficient use of water resources.","Cropping Pattern; Optimization; River Basin; Sustainability Assessment; Water Footprint; Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Groundwater; Groundwater Pollution; Linear Programming; Optimization; Rivers; Technetium Compounds; Water Conservation; Water Management; Water Pollution; Water Supply; Watersheds; Agricultural Pollutants; Crop Evapotranspiration; Cropping Patterns; Efficient Use Of Water; Linear Programming Models; River Basins; Sustainability Assessment; Water Footprint; Water Resources; Assessment Method; Crop Production; Evapotranspiration; Farming System; Numerical Model; Optimization; Precision; Rainfed Agriculture; River Basin; Sugar Cane; Sustainability; Water Content; Water Footprint; Water Management; Water Storage; Water Use; Wheat; Gomti River; India; Uttar Pradesh; Triticum Aestivum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036474234"

It is of great strategic significance to promote the sustainable development of cotton production in this area through full improvement of cultivation technology. Firstly, the main problems of current cotton cultivation and management technology in the cotton area of the Yellow River valley were analyzed in the paper. These problems mainly include the diversification of cotton planting system and planting pattern, which hinders the simplification and mechanization in cotton production; the scale of cotton production is small with poor organization; the field management of cotton is not only complicated, but also cumbersome and labor-intensive due to poor mechanization. It is also indicated that a large number of rural labors have been transferred to the city due to the fast urbanization in this area, which leads to the decrease in both the number and quality of rural labors, making it difficult to support the traditional labor-intensive cultivation of cotton. Thus many problems occurred in cotton production such as great consumption of labors, large material input and low economic benefits, which are the main obstacles to the sustainable development of cotton production in this area. Adoption of light and simplified cultivation technology is an important way to improve the Chinese cotton competitiveness in the world market and the sustainable development of cotton production in the Yellow River valley of China. Secondly, the formation and development process of light and simplified cotton cultivation technology were reviewed. The key techniques for light and simplified cotton cultivation, including precision seeding, simplified seedling nursing and transplanting, concentrated fruiting, easy and simplified pruning and fertilization, water-saving irrigation and other light cultivation techniques for cotton production were summarized and reviewed. Finally, based on the review, the authors proposed tentative ideas to simplify management, save costs and improve fiber quality and economic benefits by further improvement and development of the light and simplified cotton cultivation technology. In order to achieve a higher level of light and simplified cultivation in the future, more attention should be paid to seeding and harvesting as well as to simplifying and reducing the management process. The planting system and planting mode should be further optimized to lay a foundation for the implementation of mechanized production; the precision sowing technology should be further improved to ensure full stand establishment after seeding once; new fertilizers and their application technology should be continually developed to further simplify fertilization and improve fertilizer use efficiency; cotton varieties suitable for light cultivation and mechanized harvest should be genetically developed to enhance mechanized harvesting of cotton according to local conditions. While continuing to innovate the key cultivation technologies, the integration of agricultural machinery and agronomic measures as well as the combination of the fine variety with fine cultivation method must also be strengthened. It is foreseeable that in the near future, the light and simplified cotton cultivation technology system will be further improved, which will play more important roles in sustainable development of cotton production in this area.","Cotton; Light And Simplified Cultivation; Yellow River Valley","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035011140"

In contrast to conventional development agendas focusing on a restricted set of dimensions, the SDGs provide a holistic and multidimensional view on development. Hence, interactions among the SDGs may cause diverging results. To analyze the SDG interactions we systematize the identification of synergies and trade-offs using official SDG indicator data for 227 countries. A significant positive correlation between a pair of SDG indicators is classified as a synergy while a significant negative correlation is classified as a trade-off. We rank synergies and trade-offs between SDGs pairs on global and country scales in order to identify the most frequent SDG interactions. For a given SDG, positive correlations between indicator pairs were found to outweigh the negative ones in most countries. Among SDGs the positive and negative correlations between indicator pairs allowed for the identification of particular global patterns. SDG 1 (No poverty) has synergetic relationship with most of the other goals, whereas SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal most commonly associated with trade-offs. The attainment of the SDG agenda will greatly depend on whether the identified synergies among the goals can be leveraged. In addition, the highlighted trade-offs, which constitute obstacles in achieving the SDGs, need to be negotiated and made structurally nonobstructive by deeper changes in the current strategies.","Agenda 2030; Interactions; Sdgs; Synergies; Trade-offs; Correlation; Development Indicator; Development Strategy; Holistic Approach; Strategic Approach; Sustainable Development; Synergism; Trade-off","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036531813"

New governance models are shifting power away from states and toward the involvement of all stakeholders and the idea of shared responsibility. It's a move from command and control to push and pull. What's in this new approach for the environment? This book provides a detailed analysis of the example of integrated product policy (IPP) which aims to improve the environmental performance of products and services through their life-cycle. All products cause environmental degradation in some way, whether from their manufacturing, use or disposal. The life-cycle of a product is often long and complicated. It covers all the areas from the extraction of natural resources, through their design, manufacture, assembly, marketing, distribution, sale and use to their eventual disposal as waste. At the same time it also involves many different actors such as designers, manufacturers, marketers, retailers and consumers. IPP attempts to systematically stimulate each phase of this complicated chain to improve its environmental performance. With the involvement of so many different products and actors there cannot be one simple policy measure for everything. Instead, IPP employs a whole variety of tools - both voluntary and mandatory - which are used to achieve identified objectives. These include economic instruments, the phase-out of dangerous materials, voluntary agreements, eco-labelling and product design guidelines. IPP is still in relative infancy and can be seen as an ongoing process hugely dependent on effective governance measures to ensure its continued success. This book presents a plethora of perspectives from policy-makers, researchers and consultancies, representatives from business, environmental and consumer associations on how to effectively conceptualise, institutionalise and implement IPP. The book is divided into four parts. First, the approach to the governance of IPP is examined in relation to other approaches to sustainable production and consumption. Second, the widely differing approaches to environmental product policy in practice at national, supranational and global level are analysed. Third, the book explores the challenge of designing a coherent policy mix to support the integration of sustainable consumption and production patterns by sector and theme. Finally, the book concentrates on the key issue of how to involve stakeholders in IPP in order to encourage continuous innovations for sustainability throughout the value chain. Governance of Integrated Product Policy aims to fill a clear gap in work to date on sustainable production and consumption by providing researchers and practitioners from politics, business and civil society new insights into modern environmental governance in practice.","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121520926"

Product efficiency falls when especially non-recyclable products are thrown away without being used. Furthermore, this kind of products that unnecessarily occupy shelves of supermarkets cause supermarkets to follow an insufficient stock management policy. Unconscious and unplanned use of our limited natural resources will deteriorate the product portfolio for future generations. Such unconscious production and consumption patterns will disrupt natural balance and damage sustainability of products. In addition to creating very high costs for producers, sellers and consumers alike, these unsold or stale products lead to environmental problems due to such pricing policies. In other words, although the products have to be thrown away without being sold is attributed by many managers to be attributable to the unplanned over-orders, the actual reason is something else. The real contributor of the problem is changing purchase attitudes of customers because of wrong pricing policies of wholesaler. In addition, limited resources are also consumed fast and in unnecessary amounts. The imbalance in respect to the sustainability of these products leads to increase in the production costs, procurement costs and failure to achieve balance among products to be kept in storage houses as some of the products occupy stocks unnecessarily. In the present study, a new pricing policy is developed for product stock whose shelf lives are about to expire and generally become waste to increase salability of these products in reference to fresher stocks of these products. The present study, which is designed to reduce the above-mentioned losses, will seek to minimize the cost of waste, maximize the profit earned by supermarkets from the product, maximize product utilization rates and ensure sustainability of products and stocks as well. Fulfillment of these objectives will increase productivity and enhance the significance of product efficiency and nature-friendly attitudes.","Customer Purchasing Attitudes; Dynamic Pricing; Life Cycle Sustainability; Pricing Planning For Perishable Products; Revenue Management In Supermarkets; System Dynamics; Consumption Behavior; Life Cycle Analysis; Natural Resource; Policy Making; Price Dynamics; Pricing Policy; Public Attitude; Stock Market; Supermarket; Sustainability; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026655985"

Circular economy aims to increase economic growth by using natural resources and ecosystems in a more effective way with the aim of maintaining products, components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times. More effective use of materials enables the creation of more value both by cost savings and by developing new markets or by developing existing ones. Reduced acquisition of resources is a driver for innovation for sustainable use of materials, components and products as well as new business models. This chapter introduces methods and tools to assess and reduce environmental impacts, and improve resource efficiency and sustainability management. Life cycle thinking forms one of the basic principles of sustainable development, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the leading method for assessing the potential environmental impacts of a product, process or service throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040-44). Other methods based on life cycle thinking are also introduced. LCA focusing on the contribution of a product or service to global warming uses methods for Carbon Footprint measurement and facilitates the tracking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (ISO 14067). Water footprint is a tool that assesses the magnitude of potential water-specific environmental impacts of water use associated with a product, process or organisation. It aims at describing the impact of water utilization on humans and ecosystems due to changes in water quality and quantity (ISO 14046 Environmental management- Water footprint-Principles, requirements and guidelines 2014). The concept of handprint has recently been introduced to measure and communicate the positive changes of actions and the beneficial impacts created within the life cycle of products, services, processes, companies, organizations or individuals. A handprint of a product can be created either by preventing or avoiding negative impacts (footprints), or by creating positive benefits. When adopting the circular economy way of thinking, companies need these tools and methods to ensure resource efficiency, cost cuts and improvements in their environmental performance which provide them with more earning opportunities. Fundamental changes throughout the value chain, from product design and production processes to new business models and consumption patterns, support this trend.","Carbon Footprint; Carbon Handprint; Life Cycle Assessment; Sustainability; Water Footprint","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033200627"

In this study, to identify the optimal mulching pattern and ensure the efficient utilization of soil water in the semi-arid areas of northwest China, we tested the following five treatments for 3 years (2013–2015): (1) full amount of plastic film with flat mulching (FL mulching) throughout the whole season (FLW), or (2) only during the growing season (FLG); (3) alternating ridges and furrows where only the ridges were mulched with plastic film (RF mulching) throughout the whole season (RFW), or (4) only during the growing season (RFG); (5) flat planting without mulching throughout the whole season (NM). The results showed that FLW was more beneficial for reducing soil water losses during the fallow season compared with RFW. FL mulching enhanced soil water consumption during the maize growing season, but promoted maize production compared with RF mulching due to the increased soil temperature. The rainfall was low during July–September in 2015, and the soil water storage at harvest under FLW and FLG were 9.13 mm higher and 8.01 mm lower than the stable soil water, respectively, thereby suggesting that FLW increased the soil water supply capacity in this drought year, and thus it was more sustainable in terms of soil water utilization compared with FLG. With FLW, the average yield increased by 838 kg ha−1, 1944 kg ha−1, 2363kg ha−1, and 5164 kg ha−1, compared with FLG, RFW, RFG, and NM, respectively, and the average net income increased by 244 USD ha−1, 520 USD ha−1, 643 USD ha−1, and 1166 USD ha−1.

The RENERGY and RE-SEEties projects constitute valuable international cooperative experiences which proved that the transfer of knowledge among scientific institutions and local authorities can support a real synergy among politicians, businesses, and citizens and the achievement of the main targets of the Covenant of Mayors. Both projects produced a methodological toolkit aimed at supporting local authorities in creating a sustainable and resource-efficient future giving rise to local implementation plans ready to be endorsed. The RENERGY project, aimed at developing efficient-energy policies at regional level in an inclusive, integrative approach, focused on the transformation of urban communities from energy consumers to producers. The RENERGY toolkit had the purpose to provide local authorities with a roadmap to develop their Local Implementation Plan (LIP). The methodology was tested by the partners in their communities giving an innovative and positive approach to local energy policy whereas good practice exchanges, Energy Labs and Case Studies, contributed to the transfer of knowledge and to increase local community awareness. The RE-SEEties project was aimed at contributing to the resource-efficiency challenge by investigating energy consumption and waste production and disposal, examining the role of potential changes in consumption patterns and policy-making alternatives to support the achievement of resource-efficiency targets. A comprehensive approach to energy and waste flows at the urban level was thus adopted in order to reduce the overall carbon footprint of cities. A step-by-step methodology was devised to approach jointly energy and waste issues, whereas structured initiatives were promoted to support a change of behavior and tight cooperation between municipal officers working on different themes. The interest aroused within and beyond the involved communities, as well as the important results achieved in these two projects, testify to the importance of a proactive engagement of local governments and stakeholders on energy and climate themes, as well as the necessity of adopting a long-term comprehensive approach to ensure socially inclusive growth and a steady transition towards a low-carbon society.","Interregional Cooperation; Local Energy Planning; Resource Efficiency; Stakeholder Engagement; Sustainable Energy Policies","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017479723"

Scientific analysis of its global supply-demand pattern and prediction of its future changes constitute the basis for making the natural gas development strategy in China. The severe separation of natural gas between production and consumption forms the basic supply-demand pattern at present. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the 21st century, the natural gas field has undergone many significant and profound changes, and the shale gas revolution has changed the supply pattern of the natural gas.

The increase of demand for natural gas in China will be much faster than that of the output, which will result in the wider supply-demand gap in China. Building a scientific natural gas system based on green development, setting up the overall natural gas guarantee strategic thought which aims to deepen the reform to promote the harmonious development of natural gas industry, ensure the rapid growth of domestic reserves and production and expand the overseas diversified effective supply possess important theoretical and practical significance for the supply guarantee and the sustainable development of the natural gas industry in China.","Consumption; Natural Gas; Pattern; Strategy; Supply And Demand","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016230900"

The RENERGY and RE-SEEties projects constitute valuable international cooperative experiences which proved that the transfer of knowledge among scientific institutions and local authorities can support a real synergy among politicians, businesses, and citizens and the achievement of the main targets of the Covenant of Mayors. Both projects produced a methodological toolkit aimed at supporting local authorities in creating a sustainable and resource-efficient future giving rise to local implementation plans ready to be endorsed. The RENERGY project, aimed at developing efficient-energy policies at regional level in an inclusive, integrative approach, focused on the transformation of urban communities from energy consumers to producers. The RENERGY toolkit had the purpose to provide local authorities with a roadmap to develop their Local Implementation Plan (LIP). The methodology was tested by the partners in their communities giving an innovative and positive approach to local energy policy whereas good practice exchanges, Energy Labs and Case Studies, contributed to the transfer of knowledge and to increase local community awareness. The RE-SEEties project was aimed at contributing to the resource-efficiency challenge by investigating energy consumption and waste production and disposal, examining the role of potential changes in consumption patterns and policy-making alternatives to support the achievement of resource-efficiency targets. A comprehensive approach to energy and waste flows at the urban level was thus adopted in order to reduce the overall carbon footprint of cities. A step-by-step methodology was devised to approach jointly energy and waste issues, whereas structured initiatives were promoted to support a change of behavior and tight cooperation between municipal officers working on different themes. The interest aroused within and beyond the involved communities, as well as the important results achieved in these two projects, testify to the importance of a proactive engagement of local governments and stakeholders on energy and climate themes, as well as the necessity of adopting a long-term comprehensive approach to ensure socially inclusive growth and a steady transition towards a low-carbon society.","Interregional Cooperation; Local Energy Planning; Resource Efficiency; Stakeholder Engagement; Sustainable Energy Policies; Behavioral Research; Carbon Footprint; Energy Conservation; Energy Utilization; Enterprise Resource Management; Knowledge Management; Waste Disposal; Interregional Cooperation; Local Energy Planning; Resource Efficiencies; Stakeholder Engagement; Sustainable Energy Policy; Energy Policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009114660"

As food production systems and consumption patterns are among the leading drivers of impacts on the environment, it is important to assess and improve food-related supply chains as much as possible. Over the years, life cycle assessment has been used extensively to assess agricultural systems and food processing and manufacturing activities, and compare alternatives “from field to fork” and through to food waste management. Notwithstanding the efforts, several methodological aspects of life cycle assessment still need further improvement in order to ensure adequate and robust support for decision making in both business and policy development contexts. This paper discusses the challenges for life cycle assessment arising from the complexity of food systems, and recommends research priorities for both scientific development and improvements in practical implementation. In summary, the intrinsic variability of food production systems requires dedicated modelling approaches, including addressing issues related to: the distinction between technosphere and ecosphere; the most appropriate functional unit; the multi-functionality of biological systems; and the modelling of the emissions and how this links with life cycle impact assessment. Also, data availability and interpretation of the results are two issues requiring further attention, including how to account for consumer behaviour.","Agri-food Products; Food Lca; Food Supply Chains; Food Waste; Sustainable Production And Consumption; Biological Systems; Decision Making; Food Processing; Food Products; Food Supply; Supply Chains; Sustainable Development; Waste Management; Food Production Systems; Food Waste; Intrinsic Variabilities; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Life Cycle Impact Assessment; Manufacturing Activities; Scientific Development; Sustainable Production; Life Cycle","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84993952377"

Animal products – particularly meat from ruminants – generally have higher GHG emissions than plant products. Over the last few decades the global per capita consumption of animal products has increased. This has a negative impact on climate change, land and water availability, and human health. We are faced with the two-fold challenge of reducing GHG emissions while still producing enough food for our growing population. Part of the solution could be for consumers to change towards a more sustainable diet. In this paper we take Norway as a case study for estimating optimal taxes and subsidies on different food items which can change consumption patterns in order to reduce the GHG emissions derived from the average Norwegian diet. In the estimate we ensure that the average calorie intake with the new diet remains the same as with the current diet, and factor in other health considerations. Our findings suggest that limited but useful emission reduction targets can be set with only a few changes in diets. The methodology presented in this paper may be used to estimate optimal climate taxes and subsidies under different emission, quantities, taxes, subsidies, and health constraints.","Co2 Emissions; Diets; Norway; Taxation; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Emission Control; Gas Emissions; Health; Mammals; Nutrition; Taxation; Animal Products; Consumption Patterns; Emission Reduction Targets; Food Production; Norway; Percapita Consumption; Plant Products; Water Availability; Greenhouse Gases","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945975193"

Data for aviation growth and hence fuel demand have been projected on a year by year basis up to 2030, using 2010 as the baseline. Data sources are Eurostat statistics and actual flight information from EUROCONTROL. Relevant variables such as the number of flights, the type of aircrafts, passengers or cargo tonnes and production indicators (RPKs) are used together with fuel consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions data. The target of the European Advanced Biofuels Flightpath to ensure the commercialization and consumption of 2 million tons of sustainably produced paraffinic biofuels in the aviation sector by 2020, has also been taken into account.

However, the desiccation in deep soil layers of the apple gardens in these areas constrains the sustained development of apple industry. Therefore, it is of vital importance to study the desiccation in deep soil layers. This research aims to effectively alleviate the desiccation in deep soil layers of the apple gardens in arid areas of the loess plateau, and to ensure the sustainable development of apple industry. From 2009 to 2014, gardens with full bearing period (20 years) apple trees in Zhenyuan County, Gansu Province were selected as testing areas. The treatments included rain-harvesting patterns as black film mulching and black film mulching+ Rainfall collection tri-infiltration, which made the outside of the main trunk incline ramp, covered with black film, was in close contact with the ground compaction and ease of catchment. The tree disks been covering about Apr-20, and adopting the cultivating pattern of local farmers as controlled group (CK). In consecutive 6 years, such indexes as apple yield, new shoot growth and soil water content were localized and measured within soil layer depths of 0~500 cm, and morphological indexes of apple trees were periodically measured. Changes in apple yield, morphological indexes and relative water deficit indexes within soil layer depths of 0~500 cm at different growth stages were analyzed. The result showed that compared with those under CK and black film mulching, black film mulching+ Rainfall collection tri-infiltration made average apple yield within 6 years increase by 16.49% and 3.63%, respectively, and the rate of optimal fruit improve by 8.91% and 3.86%, respectively, so the technology prevented apple tree from yield fluctuation during years. The proportion of short shoots in black film mulching+ Rainfall collection tri-infiltration was significantly higher than under both black film mulching and CK, and enhanced by 22.75% and 11.84%, respectively. Compared with those under CK, soil water contents within soil layer depths of 300~500 cm increased by 0.50%~2.63% in black film mulching+Rainfall collection tri-infiltration. and its infiltration depth of precipitation amounts to 480cm, which was 120cm and 280 cm deeper than those under black film mulching and CK, respectively. Compared with those under black film mulching and CK, average water storage in black film mulching+Rainfall collection tri-infiltration, increased by 6.2 mm and 17.3 mm, respectively, Because the black mulching can suppress evaporation of moisture invalid, lay a 40 cm depth of infiltration, increase the accumulative and average depth of infiltration, change the physical properties of the soil, and improve root growth environment, fruit morphology index has been effectively improved. Compared with that under CK, relative water deficit indexes reached -0.038 and -0.054 0, respectively under black film mulching and black film mulching+ Rainfall collection tri-infiltration, which indicated that both treatments repressed water deficit within soil layer depths of 0~500 cm and exerted moisture-conserving effects on soil water content in apple gardens. Black film mulching+ Rainfall collection tri-infiltration made infiltration depth of precipitation remain balanced, and soil water content in the main areas of root system distribution remained unabated. Their relative water deficit indexes within soil layer depths of 60~500 cm ranged within -0.12~-0.05, and the maximum compensation depths range was within 200~300 cm. Water compensations occur at the flowering period in spring and the harvesting period, can effectively relieve drought in next spring. Therefore, extruded infiltration + black film mulching can enhance apple yield and optimal fruit rate, improve water conditions and alleviates desiccation in deep soil layers of apple gardens through ensuring water consumption for apple tree growth during drought periods in spring and winter.","Apple Orchard; Growth; Loess Plateau; Moisture; Soil Keeping Measures; Soils; Arid Regions; Catchments; Driers (materials); Drought; Film Growth; Forestry; Fruits; Growth (materials); Harvesting; Landforms; Moisture; Plants (botany); Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Sediments; Soil Conservation; Soil Moisture; Soils; Sustainable Development; Water Content; Water Resources; Water Supply; Apple Orchards; Different Growth Stages; Harvesting Patterns; Harvesting Periods; Loess Plateau; Soil Water Content; Water Compensation; Yield Fluctuations; Infiltration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957882233"

Negative ecological impacts of small hydropower have drawn increasing attention from the public. This paper used emergy analysis, one of the ecological energetic accounting methods, to evaluate the overall ecological impacts of construction and operation of small hydropower and took Guanyinyan hydropower plant in Chishui City, northwest of Guizhou Province as an example. Having capabilities in accounting multiple forms of energy and materials both from environmental and economic points of view on a common energy basis, the method of emergy analysis was widely used for supporting the evaluation of agricultural, wetlands and urban systems and was proved to be a useful tool for evaluating the overall performance of a mixed ecological and economic systems. The related indices and ratios based on emergy flows such as emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental loading ratio (ELR) and emergy sustainability index (ESI) can be used for characterizing resource consumptions, environmental impacts and overall system sustainability. Through incorporating losses of the downstream ecosystem services into the operation cost of the power production system, the results showed that the studied system was supported by a total emergy of 6.18×1018sej in 2010 to produce 2.26×1013J of electricity, of which the downstream ecosystem service losses was the largest among multiple marginal costs, accounting for 44.84% of total ecological economic cost. The losses of ecosystem service mainly included those due to biodiversity losses (especially rare species losses) and climate regulation losses, with 2.77×1018and 4.63×1013 sej/a respectively. Without considering the ecosystem service losses, the ELR of the studied system was 1.92 and the ESI was 1.22. However, when considering ecosystem service losses, the ELR of the studied system increased to 4.26, which was much larger than those of large hydropower generation projects in Mekong River or those in Korea, showing an increased pressure on local environment. And the value of ESI decreased to 0.34, which was much lower than 1, indicating that the studied power production system was not sustainable. Furthermore, the results suggested that the degradation of river ecosystem in the downstream of the dam during operation period greatly reduced the sustainability of the system. Thus, for a small hydropower, occupying environmental flows of the downstream and the development pattern at the expense of the ecosystem approach would be unsustainable. Sufficient environmental flows would be essential to the river ecosystem in the downstream, especially for maintaining the aquatic biodiversity. Environmental-friendly and social harmonious development of water resources would be necessary to achieve sustainable development for small hydropower. Relevant authorities should strengthen the planning and management of water resources development to ensure the sustainability of small hydropower and the health of river ecosystem. In addition, this paper reflected that emergy analysis, as a measure of the environmental support and the work to keep ecosystem sustainability, is an effective tool that is capable of providing an integrative assessment, and then provide a basic for the sustainable development of small hydropower.","Ecological Impacts; Ecosystem Service; Emergy Analysis; Small Hydropower; Biodiversity; Cost-benefit Analysis; Dam; Ecological Economics; Ecosystem Approach; Ecosystem Service; Emergy; Energy Conservation; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Economics; Hydroelectric Power; Power Generation; Resource Development; River; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; China; Chishui Basin; Guizhou; Mekong River","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928954841"

Results: The multi-tiered approach proposed in this article combines: 1) a Kyoto-Protocol-oriented method focused on changes in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions resulting from regional industrial production, 2) a consumer-oriented method focused on changes in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions resulting from regional consumption, and 3) a value-creation-oriented method focused on changes in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions resulting from forest management and wood usage strategies. North Rhine-Westphalia is both a typical German state and an example of a region where each of these three methods yields different results. It serves as a test case with which to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach. Conclusions: This case study argues that the choice of assessment methods is essential when developing and evaluating a strategy for reducing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Emissions can be reduced through various social and economic processes. Since none of the assessment methods considered above is suitable for all of these processes, only a multi-tiered approach may ensure that strategy development results in an optimal emissions reduction strategy.","Consumer-oriented Approach; C-sink; Carbon Footprint; Forestry And Wood Products Industry; Kyoto-protocol-oriented Approach; Multi-tiered Approach For Assessing; North Rhine-westphalia; Substitution; Value-creation-oriented Approach; Carbon Balance; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Emission Control; Environmental Assessment; Environmental Economics; Forest Management; Fossil Fuel; Regional Pattern; Sustainable Development; Germany; North Rhine-westphalia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923613823"

The development stage where China maps out the CO<inf>2</inf> emission peak target is earlier than that of the developed countries. It is a necessity that the non-fossil energy supplies be able to meet all the increased energy demand for achieving CO<inf>2</inf> emission peaking. Given that China's potential GDP annual increasing rate will be more than 4%, and China's total energy demand will continue to increase by approximately 1.0%-1.5% annually around 2030, new and renewable energies will need to increase by 6%-8% annually to meet the desired CO<inf>2</inf> emission peak. The share of new and renewable energies in China's total primary energy supply will be approximately 20% by 2030. At that time, the energy consumption elasticity will decrease to around 0.3, and the annual decrease in the rate of CO<inf>2</inf> intensity will also be higher than 4% to ensure the sustained growth of GDP. To achieve the CO<inf>2</inf> emission peaking target and substantially promote the low-carbon development transformation, China needs to actively promote an energy production and consumption revolution, the innovation of advanced energy technologies, the reform of the energy regulatory system and pricing mechanism, and especially the construction of a national carbon emission cap and trade system.","China's Carbon Emission Mitigation Target; Climate Change; Co2 Emission Peak; Energy Revolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940440137"

With an EU target of obtaining 20% of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020, national and local policy makers need guidance on the impact of potential delivery strategies on ecosystem goods and services to ensure the targets are met in a sustainable manner. Within agroecosystems, models are available to explore consequences of such policy decisions for food, fuel and fibre production but few can describe the effect on biodiversity. This paper describes the integration and application of a farmland bird population model within a geographical information system (GIS) to explore the consequences of land use changes arising from different strategies to meet renewable energy production targets. Within a 16,000. ha arable dominated case study area in England, the population growth rates of 19 farmland bird species were predicted under baseline land cover, a scenario maximising wheat production for bioethanol, and a scenario focused on mix of bioenergy sources. Both scenarios delivered renewable energy production targets for the region (> 12 kWh per person per day) but, despite differences in resultant landscape composition, the response of the farmland bird community as a whole to each scenario was small and broadly similar. However, this similarity in overall response masked significant intra- and inter-specific variations across the study area and between scenarios suggesting contrasting mechanisms of impact and highlighting the need for context dependent, species-level assessment of land use change impacts. This framework provides one of the first systematic attempts to spatially model the effect of policy driven land use change on the population dynamics of a suite of farmland birds. The GIS framework also facilitates its integration with other ecosystem service models to explore wider synergies and trade offs arising from national or local policy interventions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem Services; Farmland Birds; Geographical Information System; Land Use; Renewable Energy; Biodiversity; Birds; Decision Making; Economic And Social Effects; Ecosystems; Energy Policy; Energy Utilization; Geographic Information Systems; Information Systems; Information Use; Land Use; Population Statistics; Baseline Land Covers; Bioenergy Productions; Ecosystem Services; Farmland Bird Communities; Farmland Birds; Landscape Composition; Population Growth Rates; Renewable Energies; Farms; Agricultural Land; Alternative Energy; Bioenergy; Ecosystem Service; European Union; Food Production; Gis; Land Use Change; Renewable Resource; Satellite Data; Spatial Analysis; Strategic Approach; Agroecosystem; Article; Biodiversity; Biofuel Production; Bird; Energy Yield; Environmental Impact; Environmental Sustainability; Food Industry; Foraging; Geographic Information System; Land Use; Natural Fiber Production; Nonhuman; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Priority Journal; Species Difference; United Kingdom; England; Geographical Information System; Renewable Energy; Agriculture; Animals; Biofuels; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892842778"

While important, they are insufficient in themselves to deliver the holistic changes necessary to achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. How can we encourage corporate innovation that significantly changes the way companies operate to ensure greater sustainability? Sustainable business models (SBM) incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests, including environment and society. They are important in driving and implementing corporate innovation for sustainability, can help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes, and serve as a key driver of competitive advantage. Many innovative approaches may contribute to delivering sustainability through business models, but have not been collated under a unifying theme of business model innovation. The literature and business practice review has identified a wide range of examples of mechanisms and solutions that can contribute to business model innovation for sustainability. The examples were collated and analysed to identify defining patterns and attributes that might facilitate categorisation. Sustainable business model archetypes are introduced to describe groupings of mechanisms and solutions that may contribute to building up the business model for sustainability. The aim of these archetypes is to develop a common language that can be used to accelerate the development of sustainable business models in research and practice. The archetypes are: Maximise material and energy efficiency; Create value from 'waste'; Substitute with renewables and natural processes; Deliver functionality rather than ownership; Adopt a stewardship role; Encourage sufficiency; Re-purpose the business for society/environment; and Develop scale-up solutions. © 2014 The Authors.

The majority of the population depends on wood-fuels (charcoal and firewood) because modern energy such as LPG, kerosene and electricity are either unavailable or unaffordable. Deforestation and forest degradation is a major problem created by the current energy consumption patterns in Africa. The negative environmental impacts of cooking with wood-fuels are increasing in most African countries. Poor forest management and increasing demands are leading to land degradation, which for rural women translates to increasingly long daily treks to gather fuel-wood. On average less than 30% of the Sub-Saharan African population has access to electricity and more than 70% depend on wood-fuels for cooking and heating. The current low access to modern energy services in Africa causes negative impacts on poverty reduction efforts and the attainment of the MDGs. Despite the understanding that wood-fuels are the main energy source for the majority of the African population, improvements in wood-fuel production and use is currently not of high priority in energy development strategies. There are no specific wood-fuel policies, strategies and programmes supported by African governments. However, the use of wood-fuels is critical for meeting basic energy needs of the majority of the population in African countries. Due to this low prioritization of wood-fuels, the sector is poorly funded and lacks good governance. Therefore, securing political commitment for formulating and implementing effective policies and strategies are crucial elements that could ensure sustainable production and use of wood-fuels in Africa.","Climate Change; Energy Consumption; Indoor Air Pollution; Modern Energy Services; Policies; Poverty Reduction; Strategies; Sustainable Wood-fuels; Wood-fuels Production And Use; Wood-fuels Waste; Charcoal; Climate Change; Deforestation; Energy Policy; Environmental Protection; Indoor Air Pollution; Planning; Sustainable Development; Wood Fuels; Energy Services; Energy-consumption; Fuel Production; Fuel Use; Fuel Wastes; Modern Energy Service; Poverty Reduction; Strategy; Sustainable Wood-fuel; Wood-fuel Production And Use; Wood-fuel Waste; Energy Utilization","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930989032"

This paper based on a study, conducted in the state of Kerala, depending both on primary and secondary data, analyses the consumption pattern and farmer responses to the technology and cases thereof. A total of 840 fanners were surveyed using a structured, pretested questionnaire. Later on, the crop-wise use was estimated through a post stratification of the data. Logit analysis was done to study the adoption behaviour of the respondents. In Kerala, BF/BCA is produced by the public sector, private sector and NGO, and is distributed either directly to the farmers or indirectly through the retail shops. A sizeable part of production is sold to the Department of Agriculture itself as part of department schemes where the BF/BCA is given at subsidy. The analysis on the level of adoption of BF/BCA showed that the percentage of adoption is more in the case of BCA when compared to BF. The adoption of BF was found to be less than 1 per cent and for BCA it was around 11 per cent. The logistic regression analysis to study the adoption behaviour of the respondents (rice fanners) showed that educational level, farming experience, returns from farming and extension of technical support received by the fanners are the major factors that influenced the decision making with regard to the adoption of bioagents. Though subsidies facilitate the economic access to the technology, it did not ensure the sustained adoption and scientifically proper application. The analysis supports the statistically significant influence of technical support in the adoption of the technology, which underlines the importance of infrastructural and technological support mechanism in the wider adoption of the technology. Thus subsidies can be considered as a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the sustained technology adoption.","Biofertiliser; Logit Analysis; Sustainable Production; Technology Adoption; Agricultural Policy; Agricultural Technology; Alternative Agriculture; Biofertilizer; Crop Production; Logit Analysis; Sustainability; Technology Adoption; India; Kerala","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923293312"

Based on a representative nutrition survey in Germany from the year 2006, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to quantify nutrition-related emissions of animal and plantbased foods (excluding beverages), with a special focus on the socio-demographic factor gender. Materials and methods For the study, representative data sets concerning German food production and consumption were used. These were complemented by the Danish LCA Food database and other LCA data to analyse the impact of food imports. As regards environmental impact assessment, global warming potential (GWP) was assessed, which included emissions from direct land use change and land use (dLUC, LU), along with three inventory indicators (ammonia emissions, land use, blue water use). The following food groups were analysed from cradle-to-store and their impacts were evaluated and compared with each other: animal-based foods (meat products, milk products, egg products and fish products), plant-based foods (grain products, vegetables, fruits, potato products, margarine/oils, sugar/sweets). The reference year in the study is the year 2006. Results and discussion For all indicators, the results show strong variation between the genders. Even if the physiologically different consumption patterns among men and women are adjusted on a weight basis, men show a higher impact in terms of GWP (CO<inf>2</inf> eq.+25%), ammonia emissions (+30%) and land use (+24%). In contrast, women demonstrate a higher water demand (+11%). These differences are primarily caused by a higher share of meat and meat products in the usual diet of men (+28%) as well as of fruit and vegetables in the diet of women (+40%). If men were to shift qualitatively to the usual diet of women, then 14.8 Mt CO<inf>2</inf> eq. and 60.1 kt ammonia emissions could be saved annually. Within the system boundaries of our study, this would translate into a reduction of 12% of CO<inf>2</inf> eq. and 14% of ammonia emissions. With regard to land use, this equals an area of 15,613 km2 year -1 (-11%), whereas the total blue water demand would be increased by 94 Mm3 year-1 (+7%). Limitations within this study are caused by the system boundaries cradleto- store and are also due to the restricted set of environmental indicators which were analysed. Nonetheless, our results for GWP and land use are in keeping with previous studies. The results concerning ammonia and blue water use are limited when compared with other study results. Conclusions The study shows that within one society distinct diet profiles with markedly different environmental impacts are already established. Taking cultural and physiological considerations among the genders into account, these differences could be seen as offering potential opportunities to strengthen sustainable diet profiles. Further research should also consider health impact assessments to ensure that alterations in diet profiles due to environmental constraints do not lead to disadvantageous public health effects. Particular attention should be paid here to potentially undernourished subgroups (such as the elderly, sick people, pregnant women). © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Agri-food Sector; Diet Profiles; Diet Shift; Direct Land Use Change/land Use (dluc/lu); Hybrid-lca; Input-output Analysis; National Nutrition Survey Ii; Nutrition Patterns; Ammonia; Margarine; Ammonia; Margarine; Oil; Sugar; Article; Body Weight; Cultural Factor; Dietary Intake; Egg; Environmental Impact Assessment; Fish; Food Industry; Food Intake; Fruit; Germany; Grain; Greenhouse Effect; Land Use; Life Cycle Assessment; Malnutrition; Meat; Milk; Nutritional Assessment; Pollution; Potato; Priority Journal; Public Health; Sex Difference; Vegetable; Water Analysis; Animalia; Solanum Tuberosum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865125975"

Yet, to date, the progress has been slow. Despite being one of the greatest causes of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, meat production and consumption seldom get attention. The negative effects of the ever-increasing livestock sector are felt across a wide range of areas and much scientific evidence is left unnoticed. This includes serious contributions to environmental concerns, including climate change, water and air pollution, deforestation, land degradation, decreases in habitat and biodiversity as well as direct negative social impacts such as direct responsibility for deteriorating human physical and mental health, global inequality and world hunger, and non-sensitivity to factory farming and slaughter. This paper uses extrapolation and generalisation in assessing the impact of meat consumption on the globe, including putting it into perspective in comparison to other commonly acknowledged and accepted factors, such as transport. It also highlights some stumbling blocks, vested interests and existing attitudes that make the meat problem not only persist but also expand over the developing world. The study suggests that current decarbonising focuses are disempowering and as a result, to date, insufficiently effective. It proposes a new ethics model of increasing vegetarianism to empower individuals to make a meaningful and significant, personal contribution to climate change mitigation. It is easy and does not require significant policy, institutional or industrial changes. If adopted and implemented, such an ethics model will ensure that, individually and collectively we have the power not only to address and resolve a currently overwhelming number of social and environmental threats, but essentially, to change the current global warming trajectory and return the planet's climate patterns to safer levels.","Decarbonising; Empowerment; Sustainability; Vegetarianism; Climate Change Mitigation; Climate Patterns; Decarbonising; Developing World; Empowerment; Energy Use; Environmental Concerns; Environmental Threats; Generalisation; Land Degradation; Meat Consumption; Meat Production; Mental Health; Renewable Energies; Scientific Evidence; Social Impact; Stumbling Blocks; Vegetarianism; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Deforestation; Developing Countries; Fossil Fuels; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Health Risks; Philosophical Aspects; Sustainable Development; Meats","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84858839200"

Eco-labelling programmes have an important role in this communication. The aim of this study is to investigate what gaps there may be in the current criteria development processes in relation to a strategic sustainability perspective and develop recommendations on how such presumptive gaps could be bridged. First a previously published generic framework for strategic sustainable development is described and applied for the assessment of two eco-labelling programmes. Data for the assessment is collected from literature and in semi-structured interviews and discussions with eco-labelling experts. The assessment revealed that the programmes lack both an operational definition of sustainability, and a statement of objectives to direct and drive the criteria development processes. Consequently they also lack guidelines for how product category criteria might gradually develop in any direction. The selected criteria mainly reflect the current reality based on a selection of negative impacts in ecosystems, but how this selection, or prioritization, is made is not clearly presented. Finally, there are no guidelines to ensure that the criteria developers represent a broad enough competence to embrace all essential sustainability aspects. In conclusion the results point at deficiencies in theory, process and practice of eco-labelling, which hampers cohesiveness, transparency and comprehension. And it hampers predictability, as producers get no support in foreseeing how coming revisions of criteria will develop. This represents a lost opportunity for strategic sustainable development. It is suggested that these problems could be avoided by informing the criteria development process by a framework for strategic sustainable development, based on backcasting from basic sustainability principles. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper discusses the potential contribution of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to such a dematerialization of the industrial societies and introduces a conceptual framework which accounts for positive and negative impacts of ICT on physical flows. This framework addresses three levels: the ICT life cycle itself, life cycles of other products influenced by ICT applications, and patterns of production and consumption. The conclusion is that ICT will only contribute to Sustainable Development if this technology is recognized and used as an enabler of a deep structural change; a transition towards an economic system in which value-creation is mainly based on information processing while keeping the physical properties of material within some limits that ensure that it can be recycled. This structural change will include the transition from a material-property-transfer mode to a service-transfer mode of consumption in areas where this is technically feasible and beneficial in terms of resource productivity. In such a post-industrial society, which may also be called a sustainable information society, open technological standards will play a crucial role, since they allow for complexity reduction while keeping competition alive, thus minimizing the risk of unmastered complexity in new critical infrastructures. © 2011, IGI Global.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898239722"

Based on the notable characteristic of spatial imbalance between energy production and consumption in China, this paper takes the evolution of China's primary energy resources development(excluding hydropower) from 1949 to 2007 as the study object, with the aim to sum up the evolutive characteristics and laws of China's energy resources development in the past nearly 60 years. Then, based on comprehensive considerations of coal's, oil's and natural gas's basic reserves, qualities, geological conditions, production status, and ecological service function of every province, this paper adopts development potential index (DP)to evaluate the development potential of every province's energy resources, and divide them into different ranks. Conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) Generally speaking, China's gross energy production was increasing in waves from 1949 to 2007. From the viewpoint of spatial patterns, China's energy resources development has shown a characteristic of ""concentrating to the north and central areas, and evolving from linear-shaped to ""T-shaped"" pattern gradually since 1949. (2) The structure evolution of China's energy resources development in general has shown a trend of ""coal proportion is dominant but decreasing, while oil and gas proportions are increasing"" since 1949. (3) At the provincial scale, China's energy resources development potential could be divided into large, sub-large, general and small ranks, four in all. In the future, the spatial pattern of China's energy production will evolve from ""T-shaped"" to ""Π-shaped pattern"". These conclusions will help to clarify the temporal and spatial characteristics and laws of China's energy resources development, and will be beneficial for China to design scientific and rational energy development strategies and plans, coordinate spatial imbalance of energy production and consumption, ensure national energy supply, avoid energy resources waste and disorderly development, and promote regional sustainable development under the globalization background with changeful international energy market. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","China; Energy Resources Development; Potential Evaluation; Temporal And Spatial Patterns","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951777952"

We all aspire to economic growth that is resilient, equitable and doesn't come at the expense of the health of our environment. But despite having a fairly good idea of how consumption, investment and production patterns need to change to make our growth trajectories more sustainable, societies have been lamentably slow to shift direction. Unsustainability can be aggravated or reversed through policies, domestic and international. In this context, it now seems clear, persistent unsustainability is partly the result of embedded inertia in lifestyles, allocation of resources and technological change; partly a consequence of inadequate institutions to deliver social primary goods, and of the inability of governments to agree to and establish international arrangements that ensure an enabling distribution of benefits of global relations. In the absence of a global state, a world operated collectively by and for actors of greater or lesser economic stride, requires performing global regulatory and incentive frameworks and institutions to manage economic and physical interdependence. Our failure to achieve sustainable development is writ large across the world. While economic growth in China and India has propelled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, 2009, for the first time in history, saw our planet host to over one billion hungry people while large swathes of the developing world remain mired in economic stagnation or outright decline, environmental degradation and crippling conflict.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932131358"

The hugest fraction of the waste is biodegradable and amenable to anaerobic digestion. Successful exploration and adoption of biogas technology within the African continent context could bioconvert the vast organic wastes generated into biogas, an alternative energy source that is renewable, economically feasible and sustainable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the potential of biogas as a sustainable alternative renewable energy of today and the future in Africa. This article highlights on contemporary status of energy production and consumption patterns across the globe. It also elaborates Africa's energy picture both immediate and in the future which currently relies heavily on biomass. Moreover, the paper summarizes briefly biogas process and biogas technology as a mature technology and complete system in itself. This paper provides comprehensive extensive detailed information about the diverse organic biomass, which is abundant allover Africa and their potential biogas yield. In Africa, animal manure is not the only viable biogas digester feedstock, but there are other substrates also, which have been shown to have a better biogas potential than animal manure. Finally, strategies to ensure pilot to full-scale potential application of biogas technology are explained. Also the areas where particular research and more attention are required in the near future are identified. It was concluded from this study that waste to biogas conversion through anaerobic digestion is feasible in Africa, when approached innovatively and responsibly. This energy revolution could consequently result in a major economic impact in Africa continent.","Africa Continent; Biogas; Energy; Organic Wastes; Renewable Energy; Substrates","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892692553"

This chapter contributes to the ethical debate on how to address the on-going quest for safe and adequate food production and provision, especially in the developing and emerging economies of the South, from a critical perspective of the North. The key message is that responsibility for ensuring food security in these countries, while not undermining the natural and environmental basis for it, has to be shared among multiple stakeholders and partners. Developed countries continue to have a huge influence on the conditions for water allocation, agricultural development, and food production and trade, through development assistance, international agro- and food business corporations, international food trade agreements, food consumption patterns, etc. All these areas should be governed by very high professional and ethical standards, so that developed countries become role models for less developed countries and thus pave the way for a just and sustainable world.","Ethics; Food Production; North-south Cooperation; Poverty; Water","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960270937"

Nowadays we hear more and more about the consequences of globalization at economic and social level. The discussions with regard to consumption, nutrition and behavior seem uni-dimensional important for both corporate and decision makers. Sometimes, official sources as macro-indicators are analyzed and justified incompletely, influencing the scientists' results. In a durable way, the need to find the best solutions relies on farther important issues connected to a better approach of relation between production, environment and societal soundness, with direct implication in actively motivating both individuals and corporate. A new relation is arising, with regard to the macro and micro economic level, both affected by that so studied phenomenon of globalization. And this new relation has the human being as a centre. It certainly refers as well, to a wider (larger) variety of products made, (totally or partially), in different parts of the world, delivered at different regions of the Earth by suppliers often localized elsewhere. All these bring into equation new characteristics of risk, life and activity, the multicultural, knowledge based and complex networked economics. The globalization faces these days not only opportunities for the business owners, risks for the economies and challenges for the scientists. A new ""revolution"" in studying economics enables the entrepreneurs to get their profit in the world using global resources and capitals and creates a new society, avoiding new risks, generating new rules for sustainable development. That should be taken into consideration by scientists in studying economies, social group activities and individual behavior. Once emphasized this new economic side and social consequences approaches, the new ties between business-owners will evolve in the right direction as durable partnerships. Once an economic background evaluation done, a farther examination, at the social and societal level, will follow in order to underline the complex approach of economic analyze and the necessity to reconsider the base of economic thought. But markets do not necessarily ensure that the benefits of increased efficiency are shared by all. Markets promote efficiency through competition and the division of human resources-the specialization that allows people and economies to focus on what they do best. The development of technology managed towards a sustainable increase of transports and communication gives to the world market a more global than international approach, underlining both positive and negative sides of profit in money (not in health) versus polarization of the society and incomplete education. The evidence of these characteristics, related to aggregate indicators and structural transformation, supports the assumption that modern economic growth marks a distinct era that needs a specific approach in research to get appropriate results for both individuals and society.","Complexity Dynamics In Nutrition; Economic Crises; Globalization; Reflexive Modernity; Risk; Agglomeration; Commerce; Decision Making; Economic Analysis; Economics; Engineers; International Trade; Knowledge Based Systems; Nutrition; Profitability; Risks; Sustainable Development; Consumption Patterns; Corporate Development; Economic Crisis; Globalization; Micro-economic Levels; Reflexive Modernity; Social Consequences; Structural Transformation; Economic And Social Effects","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924423301"

Principles of landscape ecology can offer a theoretical framework for ecological planning in urban areas. With the deepening of research on the analysis of landscape patterns and their dynamics, research on the functions and processes of urban landscapes has become a new priority in urban landscape ecology. And the functional planning of urban landscapes, integrated with the planning of landscape structure, will be a main topic in urban planning. Moreover, the refinement of urban landscape functions will help ensure the sustainable development of urban areas, and the harmonization of landscape functions between city and region is an important part of urban planning, which is good for the integrated sustainable development of cities and regions. Unfortunately, recent research on urban landscape ecology has related little to the integrated regional planning of urban landscape functions. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose an approach of integrated regional planning of urban landscape functions on the basis of an analysis of the urban landscape ecosystem and urban landscape functions, with a case study of Shenzhen. As a living open system, the urban landscape ecosystem is comprised of the urban population and surrounding environment, and supported by outside energy. It is different from common ecosystems in structure, function, process, and scale, such as: (1) spatial heterogeneity of landscape patterns; (2) simplification of landscape structure; (3) horizontal landscape process; (4) determination of landscape patterns and processes on landscape functions; (5) dual scale of city and region; (6) human dominance over landscape change; and (7) landscape instability. The urban landscape is a spatial matrix of landscape elements with different landscape functions. The differing divisions of the basic functions of urban landscape is due to the background differences of scholars. Most scholars have thought that, urban landscape functions can be divided into productivity, consumption, and decomposition. Some scholars have divided them into ecosystem service functions and cultural service functions. And some have made a division into production and service functions, residential functions, and cultural functions. According to landscape ecology, on the basis of human demand, urban landscape functions can be divided into four basic functions: biological production, environmental service, cultural support, and information transportation. These functions are expressed in such corresponding landscape types as agricultural, ecological, residential, and transportation. The heterogeneous matrix of landscape types and the correlation of landscape functions are the basis of the ecological integration of urban landscape. Compared to the regional landscape, cultural support functions and information transportation functions of the urban landscape are higher, with lower functions of biological production and environmental service. Therefore, the landscape functions of the city and region are coupled together, and they support each other. Landscape functional planning in a single city cannot ensure the realization of urban sustainable development. Urban planning must be put in the context of the region, to realize the sustainable development of both the single city and the whole region through integrated regional planning of urban landscape functions. In the case study of Shenzhen, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is its background region, and the integrated regional planning of all the four basic functions of urban landscape are analyzed. The results show that urban landscape functions in Shenzhen cannot been realized without the support of regional landscape functions in the PRD, and the harmonization of landscape functions between Shenzhen and the PRD can promote regional ecosystem service functions and accelerate sustainable social, economic and ecological development.","Integrated Regional Planning; Shenzhen City; Urban Landscape Function","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-23244456668"

These areas are compared to similar ones (representing Biological Capacity), that result by converting the available raw materials and energy resources for this social-economic system, using the same criteria. Because the present pattern of consumption is far away from the demand of sustainable development, Ecological Footprint (EF) exceeds very often Biological Capacity (BC), the difference representing the Ecological Deficit (ED). The advantage of this modern concept of environmental management is the simplicity, allowing a synthetically comparison from the point of view of sustainable consumption of raw matter and energy versus the resources of the natural capital in a country, different countries or at the global level. The present paper proposes the application of the concept of EF at the level of Romania both for the analysis of the present consumption pattern and the prospective assessment of the modality in which the change in the production/consumption of energy or in Biological Capacity affects Ecological Deficit.","Biological Capacity; Ecological Deficit; Ecological Footprint","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040929802"

Recent studies indicate that current patterns of energy consumption and anticipated growth of demand in developing countries risk becoming unsustainable in the long run and hence countries need to focus on sustainable energy strategies that do not impair their development goals. While the important role renewable sources of energy are destined to play in sustainable development strategies is well recognized by nearly all nations, the development and application of these sources on a wide scale face formidable technical, economic and social challenges. Major national and international efforts are needed to expand the use of renewable energy in order to ensure that future energy systems are sustainable from an environmental perspective. Such efforts are especially needed in building the requisite institutional capacity, decentralized infrastructure, human resource capabilities, technological and production capabilities and above all an enabling environment. The renewable energy development effort will have to assume a sufficient scale and magnitude if it is to serve as an instrument of economic growth and social progress. The United Nations system is well positioned to make an important contribution to developing the strategies needed for this effort and to assisting the developing countries in implementing them.
