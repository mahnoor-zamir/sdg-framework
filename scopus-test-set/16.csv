SDG 9 aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation,” while SDG 16 aims to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.” The chapter discusses the principles of unitisation and cross-border unitisation, the process for achieving an efficient cross-border unitisation, and how the goals of SDG 9and SDG 16 can be achieved through cross-border unitisation. It concludes that cross-border unitisation is one way in which countries demonstrate that they embrace the SDGs, although the SDGs in and of themselves do not primarily promote cross-border unitisation as the parties involved in the petroleum operations are mainly driven by commercial motive. However, embracing unitisation as a commercial necessity promotes the SDG goals.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193325086"

While some of the unique healthcare needs of trafficking survivors have been studied, there is still a lack of research and insight into the best approaches for the treatment of lasting psychological trauma experienced by trafficking victims. The trauma experienced within this patient population is frequently chronic and complex, and may coincide with time frames of brain development leading to specific manifestations of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD), intermixed with trauma-coerced attachment (TCA)–often referred to as trauma bonding- to the abuser(s). Healthcare providers need to consider incorporating both psychological and pharmacological treatments to adequately address complex PTSD with concurrent TCA. However, more research and a better understanding of effective approaches for treating trafficking-related PTSD are essential to better inform survivor-centered care. Here, we present a conceptual understanding of trauma-coerced attachment and complex PTSD in trafficking victims, as well as an approach to comprehensive, trauma-informed care used at our medical safe haven (MSH). Improving the ability of healthcare professionals to effectively treat the psychological trauma of trafficked persons in a trauma-informed manner contributes to UN Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.","Education; Human Trafficking; Longitudinal Care; Medicine; Post-traumatic Stress Disorder; Trauma Bonding; Trauma-coerced Attachment; Trauma-informed Care","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124155478"

In Kenya, several groups and communities mobilize for different causes, such as peacebuilding and development. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 16 is “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”. Peacebuilding measures in Kenya take into account the community’s development frameworks and incorporate local actors, which goes a long way towards preventing recurring violence. This chapter introduces the peacebuilding and development landscape in Kenya. It considers SDG 16 in the Kenyan context and proceeds by unpacking four SDG 16 targets within the Kenyan context, namely targets one, three, seven and ten. The chapter devotes a section to interrogate feminist critiques of peacebuilding and development in Kenya. It concludes by reflecting on how SDG 16 is fundamental because it frames the promotion of sustainable peace as a development issue. Further, it provides three plausible recommendations in relation to SDG 16 in Kenya within the context of peacebuilding and development in Kenya.","Development; Gender; Kenya; Peacebuilding; Sdg 16; Women; Women’s Experiences","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196687083"

Four hundred and three college students (74% Latinx and 70% females) from a Hispanic serving institute in the southeast U.S. participated in a study to assess the extent to which they endorse HT myths and conspiracy theories, the role of identity factors in HT myth and conspiratorial beliefs, and overall HT knowledge. Results indicate that many endorsed myths of HT, had limited HT training and mixed levels of HT knowledge, and most believed in at least one conspiracy theory. Men and younger adults were most susceptible to belief in conspiracy theories. Understanding the beliefs of this population and their past exposure to HT facts can further aid in planning educational interventions to raise awareness of HT, debunk conspiracy theories, help identify victims, and potentially prevent future victimization. Improving the efforts of anti-trafficking educational efforts and addressing conspiracy theories of HT contributes to UN Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.","Conspiracy Theories; Human Trafficking; Human-trafficking Training; Myths","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164142555"

In line with the partnership between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the UN dating back to 1922, sport was officially recognized as an “important enabler of sustainable development”. The IOC and some of its stakeholders such as the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) have therefore the potential to play a pivotal role in promoting transparency and reducing corruption. Corruption scandals such as bribery of officials, betting or doping are often related to elite sport, hence regularly making headlines. But they are only the tip of the iceberg, as corruption is majorly structural and systemic within the national sport policies. Sport in Lebanon is a case in point of this state of affair. This article first assesses how rooted the corruption is in the Lebanese sport community. It will then study how transparency could be implemented in SDGs principles, and how good governance in sport could eventually lead to local sustainable development of the whole society.","Society; Sport; Sustainable Development Goals; Transparency","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159406669"

Most residency programs provide little to no education on the topic. In this pilot study, our objective was to demonstrate that human trafficking education improves residents’ knowledge, confidence, and attitudes concerning care of trafficked persons. Residents took part in a 1-hour didactic training on human trafficking. Knowledge, attitudes, and confidence were assessed in a paired pre- and post-survey with multiple-choice questions to evaluate knowledge and Likert scale questions to determine self-reported attitudes and confidence. One-hundred-four resident physicians from eight programs completed the study. Following the intervention, mean knowledge scores increased from 1.50 out of 5 correct to 4.63 out of 5 correct (p < .01). Each tested attitude and skill variable also increased significantly between pre- and post- intervention scores (p < .05). Following the intervention, 96–98% of participants answered ‘agree’ with 4 of the 5 attitude questions (p < .05). Further, 72–88% of respondents answered favorably to questions on confidence (p < .05). Physicians receiving education on the identification of trafficked persons, trauma-informed care, and community resource management report increased knowledge of potential trafficking indicators and increased confidence in identifying and providing care to trafficked persons. Improving the ability of healthcare professionals to identify trafficked persons, provide them with appropriate healthcare, and refer them to appropriate community resources in a trauma-informed manner contributes to UN Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.","Human Trafficking; Physicians; Residency Education; Training; Trauma-informed","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088942543"

Many FBOs have been and, indeed, remain actively involved in various ways with the work of the United Nations. In fact, religious or spiritual themes have been at play throughout the history of the United Nations, often mediated through central figures who helped shape that history. In an age that affirms partnership, multi-sectoral approaches to peace, and collaboration, the back stories of religious inspiration, spiritual ideas, and actors, as they have and continue to impact the United Nations, should be recognized and affirmed. This chapter addresses the ongoing significance and relevance of religion and faith-based organizations (FBOs) to the mission and goals of the United Nations, and particularly the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). FBOs are stakeholders that may indeed contribute to efforts to achieve peace and security, crime prevention, and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), most notably SDG 16: ""Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels"" (A/RES/70/1).","Faith-based Organizations (fbos); Non-governmental Organizations (ngos); Partnership; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); United Nations","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148976964"

Failed and weak states as well as post-conflict countries can be viewed as a risk to global security and consequently their reconstruction, reform and modernisation should be accorded a high priority as part of the global development agenda. This philosophy and logic provided the impetus for a global consensus that peace and stability should be a pre-requisite for international development, hence its inclusion as an integral part of the 2030 post-development agenda and framework and ultimately the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. Sustainable Development Goal 16 of the post-2015 development agenda seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. The overarching principle of Goal 16 is that sustainable development cannot be promoted if there is no peace, and conversely, without peace there is no sustainable development. If the universal goal and vision is to “leave no-one behind” relative to international development, then the popular adage of “business as usual” is not a choice, and strong and decisive action is imperative in ensuring that post-conflict and conflict-affected countries and societies in particular are steered in the correct direction in fostering growth and development.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130957006"

The Hon’ble Indian Supreme Court aptly captures the spirit of this shift when it says, ‘The traditional concept that development and ecology are opposed to each other is no longer acceptable’. The Supreme Court in this very case made the three important principles namely the precautionary principle, polluters pay principle and the concept of sustainable development as a part of the fundamental right regime under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. It is therefore clear that the international commitment, as well as the concept of sustainable development itself, is an integral part of the law of the land in India and therefore the SDGs themselves need to be read more than an international commitment. The real challenge is whether international goals backed up by judicial sanctity has resulted in the details of an executive framework to meet the SDGs or not. The SDG Goal 16, the focus of this paper dealing with ‘Peace, Justice and Institutions’ aims to ‘Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels’. This chapter examines and perhaps deal beyond numbers to ascertain the challenges for meeting the SDG goals, especially Goal 16, and what could be added to the SDG Index in order to really assess the performance of India as a nation towards meeting the SDGs.","Fundamental Right; Indian Constitution; Institutions; Justice; Millennium Development Goals; Peace; Sdg 16; Sdg Index; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200697562"

Among the targets of this goal (Target 16.5) is to ‘Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms’. Undoubtedly, the recognition and inclusion of corruption and bribery among other relevant governance aspects is laudable and necessary. This chapter examines and analyses the relationship between corruption and sustainable development, assesses regional performance through the indicators for achieving Target 16.5 of the Sustainable Development Goals and proposes other indicators and policy frameworks for improved performance toward substantially reducing corruption and bribery in all their forms.","Corruption Monitoring; Corruption Reduction; Policy Frameworks; Political Will; Sustainable Development Goals; Target Indicators","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109383297"

Transitional societies and existing democracies alike have embraced legal regimes on the right to information. An RTI law gives a person a right to demand information from a public body (and in some cases from private bodies as well) without having to disclose why the information is being sought. Such a right can enhance transparency in public administration, decrease the level of arbitrary decision-making, and facilitate citizen participation at local, regional and central government levels. It can also reduce corruption and prevent the abuse of public power. UN Sustainable Development Goal 16 commits States to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. More particularly, Target 16.10 aims to “ensure public access to information”. By examining the work of the Sri Lankan RTI Commission over the past 2 years, this Article assesses whether RTI regimes and RTI commissions can be transformative in their impact, including to help realize SDG Goal 16. Can they help generate transparent, participatory and less-corrupt development outcomes, foster a concept of active citizenship, provide genuine public scrutiny of government decision-making, and enable citizens to benefit from an inclusive development process?.","Citizen Participation; Independent Institutions; Right To Information; Rti Commissions; Rti Sri Lanka","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068365954"

This is a key pre-condition for the attainment of sustainable development, and is deeply entrenched in the sustainable development goals. While the citizens’ right to the city and to actively contribute to a sustainable world cuts across the 17 goals, the provisions of goal 16, to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels” clearly spells out the need for inclusiveness, participation, and access to information at all governance levels; which would promote a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous world (Kimani in Overview of SDGs in Kenya. Paper presented during the County Capacity Forum at Hill Park, Diani on 20 June 2016, [1]). These are central elements of democratic spaces, which are greatly being enhanced by today’s advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs). Kenya has over the recent past made huge strides in the area of promoting e-government services, which has resulted in increased e-democracy alternatives. This has particularly been the case since the creation of the e-government strategy in 2004 (Government of Kenya in e-government strategy 2004. Government Press, Kenya, 2004, [2]), as well as the review of various national laws and policies including a change in the country’s constitution in 2010. These reforms have expanded opportunities for citizens to participate in development processes, including governance. The advances in ICT in the country, which has seen mobile phone penetration rise from less than one percent to 88.1% in just 15 years (2000–2015), and broadband increase from a mere 28 Megabits per second in 2004 to 193.58 Gigabytes per second in 2015 (Export Processing Zones Authority in Kenya’s information and communications technology sector 2005, 2005, [3]; International Telecommunication Union—ITU, 2016, [4]; Communications Authority of Kenya in First quarter sector statistics report for the financial year 2015/2016, 2015, [5]) has further expanded the options for citizen engagement in shaping the country’s smart growth. As a result of these changes, more Kenyans today can easily access information on, and participate in various processes such as national and local budget preparation and plan formulation processes; demand for accountability from the political class on resource utilization; or even submit complaints on poor governance and service delivery through a diversity of platforms. Equally, citizens are able to easily and quickly access services through a few clicks on their phones or computers, services that traditionally took months to acquire through bureaucratic processes. This chapter outlines how Kenya has in the recent past adopted ICT tools and methods in a bid to attain inclusive, transparent, effective and efficient governance. It discusses how the country is utilizing various ICT avenues to promote access to information by the citizens and through which governance structures get feedback on issues. It further illustrates the existing avenues for active citizen engagement in democratic and governance processes and analyzes how effective the adopted ICT systems are in promoting inclusive and smart growth.","E-democracy; E-government/nce; Ict; Kenya; Nairobi; One-stop Centres; Public Engagement; Smart City","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064881337"
