Understanding urban agglomerations, as highly developed products of urbanization, is important for achieving SDG 11. The Sustainable Development Science Satellite (SDGSAT-1), launched in 2021, aims to characterize “human activity traces” at a fine scale to fill data gaps and address incomplete methods in the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The satellite, with a 10 m glimmer imager, provides a new and valuable data source for research related to urban agglomerations. To better describe the degree of construction and development of urban agglomerations, we established two new indicators—the City Activity Index (CAI) and the Population Activity Index (PAI)—based on SDGSAT-1 glimmer imager data. Additionally, we proposed a novel method for extracting the strength of intercity connections using 10 m glimmer imager data to reflect the current status of city linkages. These methods were combined and applied in three urban agglomerations in China: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The findings not only enhance our understanding of spatial patterns and resource flows within major Chinese urban agglomerations, but also provide actionable data support for urban planning, infrastructure development, and governance. The study fully demonstrates the advantages of SDGSAT-1 high-precision glimmer imager data in depicting urban development, and provides data support for achieving SDG 11.","Human Activity; Nighttime Light Remote Sensing; Sdgsat-1; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Agglomerations; Agglomeration; Sustainable City; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Growth; Activity Index; Data Support; Human Activities; Human Settlements; Imager Data; Night Time Lights; Nighttime Light Remote Sensing; Remote-sensing; Sdgsat-1; Urban Agglomerations; Population Statistics; Agglomeration; Human Activity; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Urban Area; Urban Planning; Urbanization; Beijing [china]; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Hong Kong; Macau; Tianjin; Yangtze Basin; Yangtze River","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009426232"

The method is demonstrated through a case study of the Plan of Central Activities for the Municipality of Pecinci, Serbia. The current theories and practices of planning central activities in Serbia primarily rely on functional factors of network flow. However, this approach aims to enhance the current practice of data utilisation for the sustainable development of central activities and integrative central places. This innovative approach considers a broader range of factors, such as economic vitality and social equity, to create a more comprehensive and holistic plan for central activities. By incorporating these additional dimensions into the planning process, the method offers a more sustainable and inclusive framework for future development in of central areas and their networks. It focuses on the morphological aspect of the distribution of centres, specifically their structure of local nodality, innovating qualitative and quantitative measures for their development, presenting statistics that categorise central places into three types: economic, social, and integrative. These categories are determined using a novel approach of data integration, which measures centrality as a major property of central places to meet Sustainability Development Goals – SDG and develop indicators for the goal 11 Make Cities and human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the role that central places play in fostering sustainable development within urban areas. By examining the economic, social, and integrative aspects of central places, we can better assess their impact on the overall well-being of communities. Additionally, by developing specific indicators for SDG 11, we can track progress towards creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. This research is crucial for informing policy decisions and urban planning efforts aimed at promoting sustainable development and improving quality of life for all residents. The data was obtained by using two open access sources: ecadastre, overseen by the Republic Geodetic Authority of Republic of Serbia, and the official cadastral base map, purchased for the purpose of performing this plan. Data gathering was done using online data sources and an official cadastral map. GIS was utilised to integrate alpha-numeric with spatial data at the cadastral lot unit. Alphanumeric values were gathered for each lot within 15 settlements of Municipality of Pecinci. The selection of alphanumeric data used land use criteria provided in ecadastre, specifically focusing on central activities such as industrial production, manufacturing, commercial offices, commerce, restaurants, cafes, cultural, government, and social services.

This paper provides a data framework for assessing centrality in urban areas, which can be applied to other regions facing similar challenges. The findings offer insights to inform policy decisions and planning strategies for promoting sustainable development in municipalities across Serbia and beyond. With the increasing urbanization and expansion of central activities in municipalities, understanding centrality is crucial for ensuring sustainable growth and development. By utilizing the framework presented in this study, policymakers, spatial and urban planners can make informed decisions, to prioritize the efficient allocation of resources and infrastructure to support central activities. This research contributes to the broader conversation on sustainable development and provides practical tools for implementing strategies that foster economic, social, and environmental well-being in territorial development.","Centrality; Data Integration; Integrated Places; Spatial Development; Sociology; Urban Planning; Case-studies; Centrality; Current Practices; Human Settlements; Integrated Place; Policy Decisions; Spatial Development; Sustainable Planning; Urban Areas; Well Being; Sustainable City","Data paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007436382"

The study area is among the highest-ranked landslide-prone areas on Java due to steep slopes and intensively weathered Tertiary volcanic rocks, which dominate the area. The annual rainfall in the Dieng region is very high, over 3000 mm/year, which represents a primary trigger for landslides. This present contribution aims at assessing landslide susceptibility through a combination of multi-temporal remote-sensing and machine learning such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The multi-temporal remote sensing approach was utilized to inventory landslide occurrences over the period from 2014 to 2024 using PlanetScope and Google Earth Platform. Those images and platform enabled us to map landslide occurrences comprehensively and accurately, in a relatively efficient manner, thereby reducing the extensive and costly fieldwork. Machine learning was applied as a solution to the accuracy issues inherent in semi-quantitative and probabilistic statistical methods for landslide prediction. The assessment of landslide susceptibility revealed that all three models achieved very high accuracy and could be applied to both the study area and other regions. However, accuracy assessment with various indicators showed that ANN produced the best results, followed by RF and SVM. Thus, the findings of this study can be adopted by national or local authorities in disaster mitigation as part of disaster risk reduction instruments. This is highly relevant to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) number 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, including disaster risk reduction.","Artificial Neural Network; Landslide Susceptibility Mapping; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Machine; Assessment Method; Landslide; Machine Learning; Mapping; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Central Java; Dieng Mountains; Greater Sunda Islands; Java; Sunda Isles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000733373"

This research analyzes data from the European Union between 2011 and 2020 by deploying the first-difference generalized method of moments (FM-GMM) model to distinguish between two different effects of the human capital variable—a low effect (negative influence) and a high effect (positive influence). The analysis has identified an optimal threshold value of 1.867 for the human capital index (HCI) score in the context of European Union countries. This threshold value represents a critical point at which the effect of human capital on achieving SDG-11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, undergoes a significant shift. The impact of renewable energy consumption on SDG-11 exhibits a non-linear pattern. There is a negative relationship at lower levels of renewable energy adoption (below a certain threshold), with renewable energy negatively impacting SDG-11 progress at a 1% significance level. However, the relationship becomes significantly positive once renewable energy consumption surpasses this threshold. This non-linearity suggests that achieving mass renewable energy adoption is crucial to unlocking its full potential in promoting the sustainable urban development goals captured by SDG-11. The results also demonstrate a positive effect on natural resource productivity both before and after exceeding a specific threshold, although the magnitude of this effect varies. This robust evidence underscores the necessity for targeted policies in the European Union to enhance human capital, increase renewable energy adoption, and boost natural resource productivity, thereby securing sustainable funding mechanisms for SDG-11.","Fd-gmm; Panel Data; Policies; Sustainable Development; Alternative Energy; European Union; Human Capital; Natural Resource; Policy Approach; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainable Development; Urban Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000510456"

This paper poses a methodological challenge in using alternative scales to monetary ranges for cultural heritage valuation. A famous Banyumas cultural tourism site is taken as a case study, and the site's utility is estimated through the method of travel cost (monetary value) and time spent visiting the site (non-monetary scale). According to consumption theory, this study finds an inverse relationship between the two scales and demand intensity. While the monetary approach mainly reflects the cost of accessing cultural heritage tourism -ceteris paribus preference- the time spent approach shows that those who invest more time in the visit are fanatics, avid enthusiasts, fascinated visitors, engagement visitors, and educated adults. These results provide more efficient policy implications in cultural tourism management and market valuation. This aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11's objectives, which encourage making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. By evaluating cultural heritage through monetary and non-monetary methods, this study supports the development of tourism policies that enhance visitor satisfaction and prioritise the sustainable management and preservation of cultural sites for future generations.","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218189764"

This goal is particularly pertinent to the EU due to challenges such as urbanization, climate change, infrastructure demands, transport issues, and natural resource management. The implementation of SDG 11 across Europe shows varying levels of success among countries and regions, highlighting the need for tailored, local strategies for sustainable urban development. The primary goal of this paper is to employ the Multi-Criteria Method Integrating Distances to Ideal and Anti-Ideal Points to determine the Sustainable Cities and Communities Index (SCCI). Using Eurostat data, this method provides a comprehensive evaluation and ranking of EU countries based on their performance in achieving SDG 11 in EU countries in 2015 and 2020. By integrating various indicators related to urban sustainability—such as access to public transport, air quality, land use, and housing conditions—the SCCI offers a nuanced understanding of how different countries perform relative to one another. The SCCI facilitates the identification of best practices and areas requiring improvement by comparing each country’s performance to ideal and anti-ideal points. This comparison allows policymakers to develop more targeted and effective strategies. Additionally, it highlights disparities between countries and regions, which is essential for fostering regional cooperation and ensuring equitable progress towards sustainable urban development across the EU. This study confirmed significant disparities among EU countries in the realization of SDG 11 in 2015 and 2020, revealing that Italy achieved the most substantial progress, while Spain experienced the greatest regress during the analyzed period.","City; Community; European Union; Eurostat; Midia; Sdg; Sustainable Development; Climate Change; European Union; Housing Conditions; Human Settlement; Infrastructure Planning; Natural Resource; Ranking; Resource Management; Smart City; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Development; Europe; Italy; Spain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214536026"

Urban development becomes essential in achieving this goal since it envisions creating a livable, smart, green, and sustainable community and addressing exposure to vulnerabilities. As a first-class and highly urbanized locality, Makati City has been Metro Manila’s financial and central business district (CBD) since the 1970s. Nevertheless, efforts to recognize risks and mitigate and prevent natural hazards no longer suffice given that there are more than 7,000 informal settler households in Makati City, with Barangay Rizal proving to be the most susceptible to disasters. Through exploratory and non-experimental research design (experimental and control group), four thematic areas were examined to determine the entry points in establishing smart resilient city development schemes, including socio-economic, environmental, technology, and institutional. A total of 120 households served as respondents from formal and informal settlements in the selected built-up environment. For a smart resilient Makati City, the implementing strategies follow a nine-step process to mainstream disaster risk reduction and management-climate change adaptation (DRRM-CCA) into the mandated plans—Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Comprehensive Development Plan. The four thematic areas provided the basis for developing a monitoring and evaluation framework, with each thematic area composed of the Smart Resilient Performance Indicators (SRPI). The Community Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) and SRPIs are essential for monitoring and implementing smart resilient Makati City. The smart resilient development scheme (SRDS) is recommended to be carried out in different dimensions such as prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery and rehabilitation for each thematic area. It should also be mainstreamed into local plans, pre-DRRM plans, DRRM plans, Crisis Management Framework, and Emergency Plan of Barangay Rizal.","Climate Change Adaptation; Disaster Risk Reduction; Resilient Development Scheme; Smart Resilient City; Sustainable Development Goal; Disaster Prevention; Disasters; Economics; Environmental Technology; Research And Development Management; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Sustainable City; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Growth; Climate Change Adaptation; Disaster Risk Reductions; Human Settlements; Metro Manila; Philippines; Resilient Development Scheme; Risks Management; Smart Community; Smart Resilient City; Urban Development; Climate Change","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009964002"

This density frequently takes over government-owned land for individual or communal purposes. The utilization of government land for personal and community purposes in East Jakarta, Indonesia, serves as a practical illustration of this phenomenon. Issues arise when the government endeavours to utilize its assets to create verdant open spaces, which will also diminish the sense of community in informal settlements. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate methods for turning public land into green, open areas while preserving the community's current social cohesion. The design study employs a participatory design approach at the initial, design feedback, and final design phases. The methodology employed has been demonstrated to enhance social cohesion within the community and convert dense urban land into green, open spaces. While further research is necessary to elucidate the efficacy of the participatory design process in advancing environmental sustainability, it has demonstrated the capacity to unite stakeholders-including government, designers, and users- to collaborate in creating cities and human settlements that are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable for the future.","Cakung Barat Housing; Informal Settlements; Participatory Design; Sustainable Cities And Communities; Urban Green Spaces","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004650395"

Land use conflicts in urban areas persist as a critical issue among stakeholders in contemporary urban development discourse. This article examines the effectiveness of local mediation strategies in resolving land use conflicts within East African cities’ rapidly expanding metropolitan areas. It focuses explicitly on community‐based leaders, referred to as “extended planners,” who foster sustainable communities through their involvement in conflict mediation. Unlike municipal authorities, whose responses can be slow, these grassroots leaders promptly engage in mediation efforts, demonstrating their critical role in urban land management. Through an ethnographic approach to data collection and analysis using the cultural‐historical activity theory (CHAT), this study highlights the significant influence that extended planners have on conflict resolution and the improvement of community welfare. The findings indicate that residents generally report land use conflicts to the Mtaa Government Office, where mediation sessions are conducted. The grassroots leaders, acting as the primary mediators, facilitate these sessions with the conflicting parties and relevant stakeholders, utilising traditional methods and established mediation protocols. The study underscores the diverse roles of different actors in the mediation process, with grassroots (Mtaa) leaders mainly overseeing it. It concludes with a call for empowering these leaders with essential knowledge in urban planning and conflict resolution skills to increase the mediation sessions’ effectiveness.","Conflict Mediation; Extended Planners; Grassroots Leaders; Land Management; Land Use Conflicts","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004589448"

It studies migration in general and rural to urban migration particular which plays a significant role in economic and urban transition. The chapters highlight important methodological issues in determining the nature of ‘urban’ and the magnitude of internal migration. Furthermore, the book presents the contributions of different factors to urban population growth, including natural increase, net rural-to-urban migration, and net rural-to-urban classification, to reflect the relationship between economic development and urbanization. It also elaborates on the regional economic disparities in India and its association with urbanization. The book elucidates the opportunities and challenges of urbanisation, presents explanations and perspectives from various theoretical and epistemological standpoints emphasising the role of a people centric inclusive urbanisation in sustainable development and human wellbeing. The book is aligned with SDG Goal 11, which emphasizes the need to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. It distinguishes between urban development policies focused solely on cities and their issues and urbanisation policies.

Although the goal primarily addresses urban development, its principles also extend to rural areas, but the extent to which South Africa’s legal and policy frameworks empower traditional authorities to contribute to the development of their communities, particularly towards achieving SDG11, remains insufficiently explored. This study investigates how South Africa’s national legislative frameworks on traditional leadership have been applied to support the advancement of SDG 11. It examines the legal provisions within the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, and relevant legislation to determine whether these frameworks provide a strong legal basis for promoting SDG 11 through the empowerment of traditional leadership. This study employs a desktop research methodology involving a comprehensive review of relevant laws, policies, and case law. Secondary data were gathered from case studies, journal articles, books, case laws, and credible internet sources. The findings suggest that the traditional authority system is deeply embedded within the South African Constitution, as well as legislative and policy frameworks, and has been effectively leveraged to advance SDG 11. Key insights emphasise the constitutional and legal recognition of traditional authorities and highlight the enforcement of traditional leadership roles and functions through various legal cases, and SDG 11-aligned programmes in South Africa. The areas where the role and functions of traditional leadership intersect with SDG 11 and rural development include security and safety, community participation, land management and sustainable settlements, cultural heritage and community identity, disaster management, and environmental stewardship. The empowerment of traditional leadership in South Africa has significant implications for achieving SDG 11 and rural development. These implications include enhanced local governance and service delivery, increased accountability and transparency, balanced rural-urban linkages, promotion of environmental stewardship, and the fostering of inclusive development. It also strengthens rural resilience, preserves cultural heritage, promotes sustainable resource management, and improves community engagement. However, challenges related to power dynamics, equity, and the need for policy integration and cohesion must be addressed to ensure that traditional leadership empowerment contributes effectively to sustainable development in South Africa.","Constitution; Empowerment; Legal And Policy Frameworks; Legislation; Policy; Rural Develop Ment; Sustainable Development Goals; Traditional Leadership","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213378242"

The proposed AI approach is effective at hypervector approximation of complex manifolds in smart city settings. The Hyperseed algorithm can generate fine-grained local variations that can be tracked for anomalies and temporal changes, as well as incremental changes in dynamic data streams. What is the implication of the main finding? This approach can be integrated into AI digital twins that have to process complex manifolds of high-dimensional datasets and data streams generated by smart cities. The interplay between digital twins and novel AI approaches is crucial in unpacking the complexities of urban systems and shaping sustainable and resilient smart cities. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Smart cities have been studied extensively as an overarching framework to address the needs of increasing urbanisation and the targets of SDG 11. Digital twins and artificial intelligence are foundational technologies that enable the rapid prototyping, development and deployment of systems and solutions within this overarching framework of smart cities. In this paper, we present a novel AI approach for hypervector approximation of complex manifolds in high-dimensional datasets and data streams such as those encountered in smart city settings. This approach is based on hypervectors, few-shot learning and a learning rule based on single-vector operation that collectively maintain low computational complexity. Starting with high-level clusters generated by the K-means algorithm, the approach interrogates these clusters with the Hyperseed algorithm that approximates the complex manifold into fine-grained local variations that can be tracked for anomalies and temporal changes. The approach is empirically evaluated in the smart city setting of a multi-campus tertiary education institution where diverse sensors, buildings and people movement data streams are collected, analysed and processed for insights and decisions.","Artificial Intelligence; Complex Manifold; Digital Twin; Hyperseed; Hypervectors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213454192"

The extent of the literature reveals that the two most pertinent technologies are building information modeling (BIM) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The radical digitization of the AEC industry, enabled by BIM and AI, has contributed to the emergence of “smart cities”, which uses information technology to improve urban operational and sustainable efficiency. Few studies have investigated the roles of AI and BIM in AEC from the perspective of sustainable buildings in assisting designers to make sustainable decisions at building and city levels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the research status and future development trends in the relationship between AI and BIM-aided sustainable building in the context of the smart city to provide researchers, designers, and technology developers with potential research directions. This paper adopted a macro and micro bibliographic method, which is used to map out the general research landscape. This is followed by a more in-depth analysis of the fields of sustainable design, sustainable construction, sustainable development, and life cycle assessment (LCA). The results show that the combination of AI and BIM helps to make optimal decisions on materials, cost, energy, construction scheduling, and monitoring and promotes the development of sustainable buildings in both technical and human aspects so to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 7 (ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable modern energy for all), 9 (building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industries, and foster innovation), 11 (building inclusive, safe, risk-resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements), and 12 (ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns). In addition, the combination of AI, BIM, and LCA technologies offers great potential to improve building performance, and the future development of AI and BIM integration should not only consider the sustainability of buildings but also consider the human-centered design concept and the health, safety, and comfort of stakeholders as one of the goals to realize the multidimensional development of smart city based on city information model.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Building Information Modeling (bim); City Information Modeling (cim); Smart Cities; Sustainable; Artificial Intelligence; Design; Digitization; Information Technology; Life Cycle Analysis; Planning Method; Smart City; Sustainability; Urban Planning","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213216194"

Satellite imagery, Google Earth Pro, focus group discussions, personal observation and key informant interviews were used. The results revealed that the proportions of farmland decreased from 19.27 to 6 %, forest cover from 24.95 to 13.98 %, and bare land from 18.84 to 2.37 % for 2004–2024. The built-up increased significantly, from 11.35 to 49.62% during the specified year. The results further indicated that the quality of habitats decreased from 0.79 in 2014 to 0.63 in 2024, due to built-up areas, improper waste disposal, population growth, road expansion, and cooperative housing expansion. Strong negative correlations between habitat quality status and the number of years of habitat quality assessment, built-up areas, waste disposal, population density, roads, and cooperative housing were observed while forest cover showed a strong positive correlation. These problems can be managed through the application of zoning laws, urban planning, compact development, mixed-use development, the promotion of sustainable land use practices, the protection of critical habitats, the development and implementation of policies to increase forest cover, and increasing public awareness. The novel component of this study is the preparation of maps for habitat quality due to land acquisition for cooperative housing development, and to aid in the accomplishment of two 2030 Sustainable Development Goals: goal number 11 (making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable) and goal number 15 (protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of land ecosystems, managing forests sustainably, and stopping land degradation and biodiversity loss). The findings inform decision-makers and planners to plan and manage the land environment sustainably.","Cooperative Housing Development; Habitat Quality; Land Acquisition; Land Environment; Land Use And Land Cover Change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203798130"

The purpose of this scoping review was to map the published literature that assessed the association between the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which tried to make cities and human settlements safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable, and ECC. Methods: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. In July 2023, a search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using tailored search terms related to housing, urbanization, waste management practices, and ECC. Studies that solely examined ECC prevalence without reference to SDG11 goals were excluded. Of those that met the inclusion criteria, a summary highlighting the countries and regions where the studies were conducted, the study designs employed, and the findings were done. In addition, the studies were also linked to relevant SDG11 targets. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria with none from the African Region. Six studies assessed the association between housing and ECC, with findings suggesting that children whose parents owned a house had lower ECC prevalence and severity. Other house related parameters explored were size, number of rooms, cost and building materials used. The only study on the relationship between the prevalence of ECC and waste management modalities at the household showed no statistically significant association. Five studies identified a relationship between urbanization and ECC (urbanization, size, and remoteness of the residential) with results suggesting that there was no significant link between ECC and urbanization in high-income countries contrary to observations in low and middle-income countries. No study assessed the relationship between living in slums, natural disasters and ECC. We identified links between ECC and SDG11.1 and SDG 11.3. The analysis of the findings suggests a plausible link between ECC and SDG11C (Supporting least developed countries to build resilient buildings). Conclusion: There are few studies identifying links between ECC and SDG11, with the findings suggesting the possible differences in the impact of urbanization on ECC by country income-level and home ownership as a protective factor from ECC. Further research is needed to explore measures of sustainable cities and their links with ECC within the context of the SDG11.","Cities; Communities; Natural Disasters; Remoteness; Slums; Sustainable Development Goal, Housing; Urbanization; Waste Management; Child; City; Dental Caries; Epidemiology; Housing; Human; Preschool Child; Prevention And Control; Procedures; Sustainable Development; Urbanization; Waste Management; Child; Child, Preschool; Cities; Dental Caries; Housing; Humans; Sustainable Development; Urbanization; Waste Management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197150080"

In addition, an interview was conducted with the chairmen of the three selected local governments. Data generated through questionnaire administration were analysed using descriptive statistics; while the content analysis methods were used for the interviews. The findings indicated that the government has not established a definitive strategy to foster development in the state. Most of its strategies have not brought the desired change and transformation needed to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Furthermore, the result revealed that there has been a colossal failure in the attainment of SDG 11 in the study area. Therefore, poor economy (89.6%); corruption (89.5%); and funding (88.1%) were the notable challenges confronting the implementation strategy of SDG-11 in Osun State.

Numerous studies confirm the health-promoting qualities of contact with nature and problems resulting from the deprivation of access to public green spaces. Easy access to safe and inclusive public green spaces is still one of the long-lasting problems of urbanized areas around the globe. It is one of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, proposed by the UN: 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Point 11.7 By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities. The major question is how to implement this goal in practice and design cities to provide easy access to safe and inclusive public green spaces. One of the important concepts for sustainable urban development is the urban block, Macrolot, coined by Christian de Portzamparc, which led to the new urban morphology of eco-neighborhoods in France. It combines the traditional, walkable urban grid with the Le Corbusier vision for a healthy modernist city offering daylight, fresh air, and greenery for everyone. Among the advantages of this particular urban morphology are the increased presence of green spaces and possibilities for placemaking. Studying the effects of the urban form of the Macrolot is of great significance for sustainable urban development. In this study, five neighborhoods—three eco-neighborhoods from France designed according to the open urban block, Macrolot urban morphology, ZAC Massena, ZAC Trapeze, and ZAC Clichy-Batignolles, and two award-winning developments from Poland, Riverview and Ostoja Wilanów—were chosen as case studies. The application of the Macrolot concept to sustainable urban planning and design and the possibilities for operationalization of the SDG—11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable—are discussed. This study offers valuable evidence to inform urban planning and design.","Eco-neighborhoods; Macrolot; Open Urban Block; Sdgs; Urban Design; Urban Morphology; Urban Planning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205058468"

However, the rapid urbanization of Dhaka city, Bangladesh, has transformed it into a prominent global megacity, accompanied by significant social challenges that impact its social sustainability status. Consequently, this study assessed the present condition of social sustainability in Dhaka city. To accomplish this objective, a quantitative research methodology was employed, utilizing a structured questionnaire survey as the means of data collection. The questionnaire is being held from May 1 to November 2, 2021, to collect as many responses as possible in this study. In this study, a multistage sampling technique was used to select 564 residents of Dhaka city. The results revealed Dhaka city residents have low satisfaction levels regarding social sustainability conditions. This indicates that there is a need for policymakers, urban planners, and implementing agencies to take action to improve the city’s social sustainability. The study’s empirical findings provide valuable evidence for informing socially sustainable planning, policy development, and practical implementation. Moreover, this research supports scholars in developing countries in broadening their perspectives regarding comparable urban social challenges. Furthermore, the study contributes to attaining Sustainable Development Goal 11, titled “ Sustainable cities and communities,” as established by the United Nations.

These refer to mobility conditions, infrastructure, land use, wider socio-economic factors, energy use and environmental and climate effects. AVs may affect all these in positive or negative ways, promoting or obstructing the promotion of specific aspects of sustainable urban development. An integrated planning framework is needed to maximise the positive impacts and mitigate the negative ones. The main obstacle in the process of developing such a framework is the absence of empirical data and experience from the implementation of this emerging technology. This chapter outlines the possible impacts of AVs and discusses their uncertainty and trade-offs in relation to sustainable urban development. The categorisation of impacts derives from the priorities of the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The chapter also highlights the lack of data for the development of an evidence-based planning approach and suggests relevant recommendations to planners. In contrast to the current lack of data, the future abundance of Big Data collected by autonomous road transport systems is discussed in the context of future urban planning purposes. Based on the above, the chapter concludes by stressing the importance of an integrated urban transport planning approach that ensures a positive contribution of AVs to sustainable urban development. Hence, it offers valuable recommendations for policymakers in a range of fields.","Autonomous Vehicles (avs); Data; Impact; Sustainable Development; Transport Planning; Urban Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195643933"

This research combines the water-energy-industry subsystem to evaluate the sustainable development performance of 29 provinces in China from 2018 to 2020. The results show that 1) a water system plays an important role in promoting a city's overall sustainable performance. 2) Urban sustainable efficiency has the characteristics of low value aggregation and high value dispersion in space. 3) Regional and sub-system sustainability efficiencies exhibit clear heterogeneity. 4) Rainfall improves the sustainable efficiency of cities, mainly through water systems. 5) The coupling between water and industrial subsystems is better than that between energy and industrial subsystems, and the coupling between the central region subsystem is the best.

However, existing efforts in urban sustainability have mainly focused on ecological and environmental sustainability, with little attention paid to development, economic, and cultural sustainability. Moreover, a lack of adaptability is a barrier to cross-nation or cross-region implementation of many urban sustainability frameworks due to diverse urban contexts. Furthermore, most studies have developed sustainability frameworks and guides only for one-time assessments and the progress of urban sustainability has been neglected. Improving urban sustainability by considering multiple dimensions and local adaptability through dynamic assessment remains a question. Therefore, this study aims to develop an urban environment examination system (UEES) framework that includes construction, economy and industry, environment and resource, municipal and cultural facilities, and development potential dimensions. The UEES framework consists of 31 indicators associated with critical information (i.e., reported by the statistical yearbooks) from different levels of government in China. An annual update of statistical data ensures the availability of dynamic data, allowing urban managers and decision makers to regularly track urban sustainability. Furthermore, the UEES framework was applied to Qingdao, an urbanizing city in China, to examine the feasibility of the UEES framework. The results indicate that well-urbanized districts could perform better in terms of overall sustainability (e.g., Shinan, Shibei, Laoshan, Chengyang), while districts in suburban and outer suburban areas had lower urban sustainability levels. However, well-urbanized districts could not perform better in all dimensions than suburban and outer suburban districts. Moreover, the transition from less-urbanized to well-urbanized districts could lead to environmental deterioration and economy deceleration (if industries are not well upgraded), but culture and development sustainability can be improved. Overall, this study provides a methodological framework that prioritizes comprehensiveness and local adaptability to perform regular urban environment examinations for urban sustainability in China and provides a reference for urban sustainability improvement by identifying aspects with low scores in Qingdao, China.","Construction; Development Potential; Economy And Industry; Environment And Resource; Methodological Framework; Municipal And Cultural Facilities; Urban Environment Examination; Urban Sustainability; Government; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Area; China; Qingdao; Shandong","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190244486"

Floods do not escape this rule. This article sheds light on an unknown intense rainfall period, which affected the Campania region and the territory of the current Molise region (Southern Italy) on October–November 1961. The period culminated in floods, particularly involving the town of Benevento (Campania region), which had been affected by several inundations over centuries. The research made an extensive use of unpublished archival sources. The documents allowed us to both outline the pluviometric and hydrological picture of the period and catalogue seventeen physical and environmental effects suffered by over two hundred municipalities. Furthermore, we also disclosed the economic consequences in the wide territory involved. Special attention was paid to Benevento, for which we also drew up the scenario map related to the 19 October flood. For this town, historical data were effective for developing and testing the hydraulic model of the Sabato and Calore Rivers, which overflowed at the site. In this regard, we made some considerations on the current flood risk of the town. From a methodological point of view, we stress the importance of a historical approach in close relationship to other expertise for the knowledge of natural hazards, tracing also some future perspectives. The research complies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Goal 11 concerned with making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The research findings will be useful for scholars and practitioners for both improving flood hazard models and arranging archival research path. Finally, local authorities in charge of risk mitigation can also benefit from the research results.","1961 Floods; Cultural Heritage; Historical Sources; Hydraulic Models; Natural Hazards; Cultural Heritage; Flood; Historical Record; Hydrological Modeling; Knowledge; Mitigation; Natural Hazard; Rainfall; Sustainable Development Goal; Benevento; Campania [italy]; Italy; Molise","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190233664"

It contributes to the health-environment literature but differs from two standpoints. First, it uses two essential sources of carbon emissions: liquid and solid fuels. Second, it engages robust analyses comprising the full sample and sub-samples of income groups to further interrogate this intrinsic relationship. For this purpose, an unbalanced sample of 36 countries from Asia and the Pacific region (2005–2010) is used, and for robust analyses, three econometric methods: bootstrap ordinary least squares (BOLS), instrumental variables (IV), and system generalized method of moments (GMM) are implemented. Empirical results reveal that: (1) liquid and solid fuel emissions exert significant negative outcomes, (2) liquid fuel emissions exhibit the most adverse effect, (3) life expectancy is persistent, and (4) impact of liquid and solid fuel emissions on life expectancy across the income groups is diverse. These findings suggest that the management authorities of Asia and the Pacific region need to devise prudent and effective policies concerning human health and carbon emissions while allocating sufficient budget to the health sector to rescue more lives and, thereby, lengthen the life expectancy in the region.","Asia And The Pacific Region; Carbon Emissions (environmental Degradation); Life Expectancy; Liquid Fuel Emissions; Solid Fuel Emissions; Carbon Emission; Econometrics; Empirical Analysis; Environmental Degradation; Fuel; Health Services; Life Expectancy; Source Identification; Asia; Pacific Islands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161162030"

This presents a challenge for the island to attain its commitments to reduce its GHG emissions to 30% by 2030 to cater for SDG 13 (Climate Action). Moreover, issues like eyesores caused by littering and overflowing of bins and low recycling rates due to low levels of waste segregation are adding to the obstacles for Mauritius to attain other SDGs like SDG 11 (Make Cities & Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient & Sustainable) and SDG 12 (Guarantee Sustainable Consumption & Production Patterns). Therefore, together with an optimisation of waste collection, transportation and sorting processes, it is important to establish a solid waste characterisation to determine more sustainable waste management options for Mauritius to divert waste from the landfill. However, traditional waste characterisation is time consuming and costly. Thus, this chapter consists of looking at the feasibility of adopting machine learning to forecast the solid waste characteristics and to improve the solid waste management processes as per the concept of smart waste management for the island of Mauritius in line with reducing the current challenges being faced to attain SDGs 11, 12 and 13.","Landfill; Smart Solutions; Solid Waste Characterisation; Sustainable Waste Management; Waste Collection; Waste Sector","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189128170"

However, the construction challenges and greater fuel loads involved have resulted in frequent fire incidents, causing significant losses in terms of life and property. This has led engineers and researchers around the world to develop safety measures. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend the physics behind fire and smoke propagation in high-rise buildings and take steps to prevent their future occurrence. This also greatly aids in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the Paris Agreement, specifically goal 11, i.e., make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. This chapter presents an overview of characteristics for understanding high-rise building fires with a particular focus on façades. It has been further divided into different sections. First, basic terminology of façades and fire growth curve is discussed followed by design fire scenarios. Next, characteristics and mechanisms of façade fires are explained. Finally, the solution to adopt artificial intelligence (AI)/deep learning technologies for early warning and fire risk assessment is introduced. AI can be used to simulate fire scenarios, helping architects and engineers design efficient fire safety systems.","Artificial Intelligence; Façades; Fires; Regulations; Safety; Sustainability","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198562117"

Results show that car ownership, travel distance, age, gender, academic status, income, perception of safety, number of weekly trips, and weather conditions affect people’s mode choice decisions significantly. The study finds that increasing travel distance, age, and being a staff member positively impact car mode choice, faculty members are more likely to bike and walk compared to undergraduate students, and unlike the authors’ predictions, the higher-income people are more likely to walk on campus. Results also reveal that car users change travel modes more often than active transport mode users based on semesters and that although women are less likely to bike to the campus, they are more likely to walk and bike on campus. If the number of trips increases, people prefer cars to walk, bike, and ride a bus to commute to the campus while they prefer walking to driving a car on campus. The study contributes to help create pollution-free and healthy urban college campuses that, on larger scales, will further contribute to developing sustainable cities to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals as described by the United Nations, particularly goal number 11, “to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,” and thereby contribute to improving urban living conditions.","Active Transportation; Commuting To And On College Campus; Mode Choice Behavior; Sustainable Cities And Communities; Sustainable Development Goals","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207523920"

The paper broadly begins with an interest in sustainable designs of urban residential neighborhoods globally and specifically in typical cities of India and the Asian subcontinent. The UN SDG 11 mentions, 'make cities & human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.' While the most evident sustainability parameters are known, one of the commonly understated criteria is noise pollution. Hearing is one of the five fundamental senses; hence, safer sound levels should be one of the primary factors in designing healthy cities. Literature understandings are derived from soundscape theories of Schafer & Truax, who extended the concept of acoustics from architecture to an urban scale; inferences are drawn from legislations and co-related with current scenarios investigated by way of primary surveys in the fast-growing city of Bangalore, India. The study proposes a methodological triangulation with three aspects of primary data collection: field surveys for street-level acoustics (using sound meters/smartphone Apps), Interview surveys (in-person), and Questionnaire surveys (online). Results revealed a sharp difference between the norms' acoustical thresholds and the audited survey scores. Upon analytical deductions, the study concludes with a strategic framework for an integrated approach to achieve ‘urban acoustical resilience’ that responds to spatial patterns. This framework suggests strategies under two broad aspects of design guidelines and a regulatory mechanism to achieve globally acoustical-compliant sustainable neighborhoods.","Liveability; Soundscape Audits; Street-level Acoustics; Urban Neighbourhoods; Acoustics; Neighborhood; Noise Pollution; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; Urban Design; Urban Planning; Bengaluru; India; Karnataka","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200795379"

In this context, cities are pivotal for social and economic development, serving as gathering places where everyone should enjoy a high standard of living and accessibility. Public transportation, particularly bus comfort on board, significantly influences the quality of urban transportation services. Measuring this comfort is essential for transportation providers to track, assess, and implement targeted improvements. Comfort is a complex concept influenced by factors like temperature, noise, vibration, acceleration, passenger load, and cleanliness. The literature offers various approaches to measuring bus comfort, prompting this paper's review of existing research to establish a structured research base for future studies. Despite a wealth of literature on onboard bus comfort levels (OBCL), no methods yet establish graduated, dynamic comfort scales incorporating diverse passenger characteristics and real-time acceleration data. This gap prevents a comprehensive, real-time OBCL assessment that accurately reflects passenger experiences. Furthermore, extensive data collection is necessary to calibrate models and consolidate comfort scales effectively. The insights from these studies help identify specific areas where comfort levels are inadequate, enabling transportation agencies to focus on targeted interventions for enhancing the passenger experience.

The industry has been slow to embrace digitalization, relying heavily on manual work and outdated project management practices. This has led to complex and time-consuming projects, hindering Malaysia’s progress as a developed country and causing issues such as high housing prices and traffic congestion. Furthermore, the industry’s resistance to change and the fear of job loss impedes the adoption of robotics and automation. This study aims to identify strategies to build trust and promote the use of robotics and automation in the Malaysian construction industry. An in-depth interview survey was done with 14 respondents from different backgrounds in the industries including clients, contractors, and consultants. The approach for physical in-depth interviews begins with contacting respondents who meet the requirements, and an in-depth interview date that is judged acceptable is then set up. In connection with the digital revolution, another approach of contacting more significant respondents is to provide the in-depth interview questions by building an interview form online for respondents who are unable to meet physically. A thematic analysis review from the interview was analyzed to identify the issues and strategies to build trust in robotics and automation in the construction industry. The study findings show that there are three main issues in the matter which are economy, promotion, and enforcement while the strategies to countermeasure the issues are economy, enforcement, and training. The study finding can assist in helping to understand the need of raising trust in the matter and implementing suitable strategies to utilize robotics and automation to the fullest, as well as to serve as a guideline for industry practitioners to integrate new technology into design and construction to reduce time-consumption, cost, and increase quality of work that aligns with Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) number 11 which is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.","Automation; Construction; Malaysia; Robotic; Trust; Construction Industry; Costs; Employment; Job Analysis; Project Management; Traffic Congestion; Developed Countries; Housing Prices; In-depth Interviews; Interview Survey; Job Loss; Malaysia; Malaysian Construction Industry; Project Management Practices; Resistance To Change; Trust; Robotics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200392831"

A survey was carried out with citizens from both cities, with a convenience sample. A digital city must be a democratic space for housing, work, leisure, study, health, safety, innovation, food, shopping, urban mobility, and socialization between people, in an inclusive way and with quality of life for everyone. In this context, the International Organization for Standardization’s indicators for digital cities are essential to evaluate the levels of adherence in the mentioned aspects and to develop planning to define effective public policies to achieve digital cities and the quality of life of citizens.

Cycle-transit provides a number of environmental and societal benefits that contribute to the SDG 11, which calls for cities and human settlements to be inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. One of the modes of transportation in Indonesia that already supports cycle-transit activities is the MRT Jakarta. The cycle-transit facilities include bike on board, bike parking, bike lane, and bike sharing. MRT Jakarta continues to develop cycle-transit facilities, aiming to shift the travel behavior of Jakarta citizens. MRT Jakarta improvement is financed with public money, so the community should perceive the benefits as much as possible. It is necessary to know the users’ needs for cycle-transit facilities in MRT Jakarta. This article is a part of ongoing research to formulate recommendations for improving cycle-transit facilities in MRT Jakarta. This paper analyzed the improvement priority of four types of cycle-transit facilities at MRT Jakarta based on users’ needs using AHP. The analysis shows that the users need the addition of bike on board access and some improvements on its supporting infrastructure. These findings will be valuable to PT MRT Jakarta and DKI Jakarta Provincial Government as decision-makers to develop cycle-transit facilities in the future.

This milestone reaffirms the nation’s sovereignty and signifies its financial autonomy and independence. However, elevation to middle-income status should not overshadow future challenges. Experts in the field have raised concerns that Bangladesh may become entrapped in the cycle of middle-income status, thereby impeding further advancement towards achieving developed-country status. To progress, the nation must formulate a comprehensive plan to attain developed country status by 2041. PURPOSE: Housing is considered a fundamental right for citizens in Bangladesh as per its constitution; however, a significant population in the capital city of Dhaka lives in overcrowded slums or lacks basic shelter altogether (Khasru et al., 2019). The SDGs recognise the need for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities for human settlements, particularly for the 1 billion slum dwellers worldwide, who often lack access to public transportation and suffer from poor air quality and solid waste problems. Many countries are implementing various projects to address these issues and meet the SDGs. Bangladesh is one of the few countries to implement the SDGs by the UN, achieving significant indicators even during and after the COVID pandemic; this was due to timely and systemic steps by the government and civil society organisations (CSOs). The primary objective of this paper is to examine the role of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) in promoting sustainable housing and its efforts in implementing sustainable housing practices within a city of 20 million people as a regulatory authority aligned with the SDGs. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study uses primary and secondary data to focus on sustainable housing conditions in Bangladesh’s capital city. The study will employ secondary data collection methods such as a literature survey, government document analysis, and archive exploration. To determine the role of the regulatory authority, the study will employ primary data collection methods such as semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Furthermore, the secondary literature review will determine the regulatory authority’s limitations in ensuring sustainable housing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. By employing such methods, the study will propose policy recommendations for better working conditions and improvements in service delivery by Bangladesh regulatory authorities. FINDINGS: To provide sustainable housing and implement SDG 11, various government agencies and CSOs work together in Dhaka. The Capital Development Authority (CDA), also known as Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), is the top organisation that makes policies and decisions to ensure the capital is sustainably inhabitable for current and future generations. However, the failure to collaborate with other government agencies, local government organisations, CSOs, and individual landowners has prevented RAJUK from implementing its significant policies, including the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for Dhaka (Ranjbari et al., 2021). To address the housing crisis and implement SDG 11 in Dhaka, it is essential to develop sustainable solutions. First, the government must ensure that policies are implemented collaboratively with all stakeholders. Second, it is crucial to incorporate affordable and eco-friendly housing designs, energy-efficient building materials, and proper waste management practices (Haque et al., 2022). Third, sustainable transportation options, such as mass rapid transit systems and bike-sharing programmes, must be developed. Fourth, the government must promote public awareness and community engagement through education campaigns and community-based approaches. Finally, partnerships with CSOs can help ensure the involvement of marginalised and vulnerable populations.","Detailed Area Plan; Housing; Liveable City; Sdgs; Sustainable Housing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194388214"

Humans as residents who live in a settlement act as subjects and objects in development so the role of humans in the quality of settlements is also closely related. Settlement quality is one of the goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), more precisely, the 11th goal which aims to make cities and settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The general problem related to the quality of settlements is that most areas still have inadequate quality settlements and the density of existing settlements exceeds the carrying capacity and carrying capacity of the environment. This can affect the decline in environmental quality in these settlements. Diseases that occur due to environmental conditions can occur due to interactions between humans, human behavior, and the environment in which they live that have the potential to transmit disease. Poor residential environmental conditions will increase the risk of environmental-based disease transmission. One of the common environmental-based diseases that occurs in settlements is leptospirosis which is usually caused by poor environmental sanitation conditions and the presence of rats. Poor environmental conditions will indirectly affect the health conditions of residents, such as mothers and children in the house. Poor maternal and child health creates opportunities for stunting to occur. Stunting is a nutritional status outcome that occurs when a child has a height of less than -2.0 standard deviation (SD) compared to the population average.","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190640019"

Taking the Beijing Sixth Ring Road area as the study region, the results indicate that tall, large–area, multi–functional buildings have a significantly positive impact on urban vitality. These areas exhibit single–function buildings and high levels of greenery, leading to inefficient space utilization. Increasing road network density, as well as the density of transportation and public facilities, also positively influences urban vitality. However, commercial density has a negative impact on workday vitality. Furthermore, excessive green space density, a high proportion of the largest green patches, and complex green space borders all contribute to a reduction in urban vitality.","Big Geo-data; Mgwr; Urban Morphology; Urban Vitality; Roads And Streets; Urban Transportation; Big Geo-data; Exploratory Studies; Geo-data; Geographically Weighted Regression; Green Spaces; Multi-scales; Multi–scale Geographically Weighted Regression; United Nations; Urban Morphology; Urban Vitality; Morphology; Greenspace; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Morphology; Beijing [beijing (ads)]; Beijing [china]; China","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188245562"

The study was conducted on vegetable farmers along the little Akaki River in Addis Ababa. Field data was collected from 156 randomly selected vegetable farmers via semi-structured survey questions. Climate data from 1996 to 2020 was analysed using qualitative and quantitative descriptive statistics methods. The results of monthly and annual precipitation variability indicated a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 23% to 73% and 49% to 98%, respectively. Seasonally, CV ranges between 34% and 99%, 50%–97%, and 20%–84% in Belg, Bega, and Kiremt, respectively. The results of respondents' perceptions indicated an increasing trend in temperature and precipitation variability. Vegetable urban farmers perceived an increase in the frequency of floods and rain falls (44.9%), drought frequency (13.5%), temperature (89.7%), and a decrease in the trend of vegetable productivity (86.5%) as the major impacts of climate variability. However, changing vegetable varieties (31.4%), early planting (26.9%), mixed farming (26.6%), late planting (5.1%), using agrochemicals (4.5%), and agroforestry (1.9%) are the major on-farm climates where smart agriculture technologies were identified for adaptation. Shift occupation (37.8%), nonadaptation (36.5%), and non-farm activations (24.4%) were employed by the farmers as off-farm adaptation options. In addition, vulnerability analysis indicated that the absence of direct access to the market, inadequate access to weather information, land fragmentation, and tenure complications are the major determinants of being vulnerable. Finally, high precipitation and temperature variability affect vegetable productivity. Practical Implications: Climate extreme phenomena are substantial pressures on urban agricultural production systems in risk-prone cities, where climate service challenges are rising globally (Sanfo et al., 2022; Kifle et al., 2022; Ebissa and Desta, 2022); besides, the requirement to produce more urban vegetables to feed residents, an ever-increasing and vulnerable group, is undeniable (Martinez et al., 2022). Additionally, climate variability and change threaten urban and pre-urban farmers’ livelihoods and agricultural farming, particularly in semi-arid areas in Africa (Magesa et al., 2023). Furthermore, 64 % of the world's poorest people lived in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020, which strongly requires the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger) and 11 (make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable) in the region (Magesa et al., 2023; Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021; Degefu et al., 2021c). Thus, cities are exposure to compatible climate information services is vital for anticipating climate variability risks in vegetable production, optimizing the training of practitioners (urban farmers), and adapting to climate change through climate smart agriculture technologies (Degefu et al., 2021a; Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021; Kifle et al., 2022). Moreover, it is compulsory to ascertain and analyze impact insights and their origins, vulnerabilities, and adaptive potential among urban farmers before beginning with the exercise of any given climate service to understand the demands of urban vegetable farmers and the possible exploitation of nexuses (Dendir and Simane, 2021). Conversely, in Ethiopia, the agriculture sector is identified as one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change and vulnerability (Kifle et al., 2022). On top of these, the productivity and the concern of urban agriculture (vegetable production) is highly ignored and reduced the potential, productivity and suitability of ecological land (Kifle et al., 2022; Degefu et al., 2021b; Degefu et al., 2021c). Besides, the combined effect of climate variability, population pressure, and urban ecosystem dynamics reduced urban vegetable production and leads the farming community into a viscous of poverty circle and worsens food security (Amberber et al., 2020; Degefu et al., 2021c). However, previous studies have revealed that the effectiveness of climate information services on urban ecosystems depends on (i) the ability of urban farmers to access, understand, and overcome institutional constraints (Kiplagat et al., 2022) (ii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Dendir and Simane, 2021), and (iii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Martinez et al., 2022). To that end, the disparity between the awareness of urban farmers and policymakers towards the benefits of CSA and their practices implies that indigenous knowledge-based research on CSA farming and land management technology should be conducted. Therefore, it is crucial to appreciate the practices and adoption of CSA at the city level to realise triple-win outcomes: increased productivity, enhanced resilience, and mitigating climate variability and change.","Climate Smart; Climate Variability; Impact; Urban Farmers; Vegetable; Agricultural Production; Metropolitan Area; Urban Agriculture; Urban Area; Vegetation Dynamics; Addis Ababa; Ethiopia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181141037"

The urban human settlement development trajectory requires that urban settlers occupy an area planned and already serviced with offsite infrastructure, but in this instance, people occupied and built on land both unserviced and unplanned. There are no defined boundaries for residential stands, let alone clear circulation networks, road infrastructure, water and sewer reticulation networks, adequate social services such as schools and clinics, community boreholes, or water points. The extent of the area identified for the study is Zone 6, that only forms part of the whole Hopley settlement. Participatory GIS application in settlement upgrading ensures that slums in wetlands, and the total number of slums that need relocation or demolition, are identified. There will be improved access to the tenure system, housing quality and climatic change awareness. This fulfils the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number 11 that seeks to promote and improve the standard of living of people, thereby creating an inclusive, safe and resilient urban society. Part of the settlement that is closer to the roundabout (Ward/Zone One) was identified by Government for the Garikai Housing scheme and is being formalised. Urbanisation is most pronounced in lower-middle-income zones (high-density areas) of the developing world, creating many spatially related problems that include the mushrooming of uncoordinated settlements called slums/shacks, widely known for lacking corresponding basic infrastructural services, such as water and sanitation, roads, electricity, sewer networks, schools, clinics, hospitals and commercial and business centres. It is estimated that in Sub-Saharan Africa about 14 million people migrate to towns and cities each year. Out of this figure, about 70% end up in slum settlements, with only 30% living in formal settlements.","Geo-referencing; Gis; Participatory Gis; Slum Upgrading; Spatial Objects","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179311847"

However, developing countries lagged behind in terms of knowledge on the causes and mechanisms to withstand and mitigate the ravaging effects of flood disasters. Using the root cause analytical lens, this study explored informal city dwellers’ knowledge and understanding of the causes of flooding in African cities. Qualitative data involving focus group discussions and key informant interviews were sourced from a flood-prone informal settlement in Harper City, Liberia and supported with desk review. Findings show that human factors are the predominant causes of flood disasters in African cities as against the natural or climatic factors. Human factors such as poor urban planning and development of the city, a poor drainage system, poor solid waste management and non-enforcement of laws, rules and regulations guiding building codes in the city were highlighted. Considering, the fact that the contributory human factors can be controlled, there is the urgent need for African city planners and stakeholders to prioritize flood mitigation strategies along the anthropogenic causes. The study argues that the attainment of sustainable development goal 11—safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable human settlement by 2030 in Africa rests on robust urban planning policies focused on mitigating the anthropogenic causes of flood disasters in African cities.","Climatic Factors; Flooding; Human Factors; Natural Disaster; Root Cause Analysis; Sustainable Cities","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177212755"

Based on social cognitive theory (SCT), this study clarifies the specific mechanism shaping local public acceptance of NIMBY facilities with two types of hazardous effects (i.e., pollution and psychological exclusion) using a large-scale questionnaire survey and structural equation model. The results reveal that, firstly, SCT provides a solid theoretical basis for exploring the mechanism under the joint action of environmental and personal factors. Secondly, it is verified that self-efficacy indirectly predicts local public acceptance by influencing perceived risk. The effect of the positive affect tag is mediated by perceived risk in shaping acceptance of polluting facilities but not of psychologically excluded facilities. In general, people tend to have a lower perceived risk, higher perceived benefit, stronger sense of self-efficacy, and more positive attitude when faced with the siting of psychologically excluded NIMBY facilities over polluting ones. These findings are helpful for planning and decision-making of NIMBY facilities with different types of hazardous impacts, reducing NIMBY conflicts and promoting the construction of NIMBY infrastructures. Furthermore, it contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 (promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development) and (SDG) 11 (building inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements).","Nimby Facilities; Polluting; Psychologically Excluded; Public Acceptance; Social Cognitive Theory; Cognition; Psychology; Questionnaire Survey; Risk Perception; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198221661"

The growth of settlements comes at the expense of natural and agricultural land. Understanding urban growth dynamics, defined in this study as new urban development, can lead to an increased awareness of the stresses on land resources and the suitability of current land use policies. It can also reflect how changes in the economic cycles and planning policies can influence these dynamics. This is even more critical in small island states, where land is a scarce resource. This study uses data extracted from development-planning applications between 1993 and 2019 in order to understand urban growth in the island-state of Malta. A methodology was developed to (i) use web-scraping techniques to extract development-planning applications data from a public online database in order to define development descriptors, (ii) establish keywords that imply growth within the urban area, and (iii) analyse growth in view of local planning zones and regulations. The results show that over the years, there has been a decrease in the share of granted development-planning applications that lead to the growth of the urban area when compared to those granted applications permitting other forms of development, such as that linked to minor modifications to existing buildings and restoration works amongst others. Nonetheless, the absolute number of granted development-planning applications resulting in growth has increased, particularly in the last construction boom (post 2013). The share of applications denoting growth granted within the development zone has remained stable throughout the years. The years with the highest numbers of permits granted outside the development zone, where there was a disposition against development, were 2017 and 2018. In conclusion, the trends and patterns resulting from development cycles were analysed and discussed. The outcomes of this work will lead to better measurement of urban growth in Malta and assess the efficacy of current national development-planning policies. This is in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 11, which aims at making “cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable”. The research specifically addresses Target 11a, which is focused on supporting “positive economic, social, and environmental links between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning”.","Development Zones; Development-planning Applications; Islands; Malta; Sustainable Land Management; Text Mining; Urban Growth; Island; Local Planning; Regional Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Area; Urban Growth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189426793"

Geoscience can play a significant role in achieving targets within this goal by developing a better understanding of geological properties and processes within urban environments, and by ensuring that this understanding is integrated into urban development. A key step in this process will be enhancing awareness of urban geology among non-geoscience decision-makers, so that inherent subsurface risks and benefits are understood and accounted for during all phases of development. Three-dimensional geological models are an effective tool for geologists to communicate with stakeholders in government and industry during that process. They can also provide a framework to enable geological data and information to be integrated into Building and City Information Models, and thus facilitate more effective infrastructure and utility asset management. This paper describes the modelling workflow adopted by a consortium of geoscientists from government, industry and academia to deliver the first 3D geological model of Kuala Lumpur – 3DKL v1.0. The modelling workflow involved: digitising borehole logs from site investigation reports and storing them in a dedicated geospatially-enabled SQLite borehole database; viewing and interpreting that borehole data using QGIS software; generating multiple orthogonally oriented cross-section profiles across the modelled area using Groundhog Desktop software; and integrating the information derived from the interpreted boreholes, surface data and cross-section profiles to generate a 3D geological model in Leapfrog Geo software. 3DKL v1.0 has demonstrated proof-of-concept: we have developed a workflow, based largely on freely-available software, for transforming borehole information, previously captured in paper records, into a conceptual 3D model. The modelling process has also identified areas where geological knowledge and data need to be enhanced if 3DKL is to fulfil its potential to support more sustainable and resilient urban development in Kuala Lumpur.","3d Modelling; Digital Workflows; Engineering Geology; Geoscience Databases; Kuala Lumpur Geology; Un Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Geology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178441178"

However, the lack of community participation in waste bank activities is an obstacle to managing waste banks. One of the reasons they have yet to become participants or customers of Waste Bank is that it takes a long time to collect their waste until it is ready to be deposited into the waste bank. Based on these problems, we propose a crowdsourcing mobile application design solution for community participation in waste management. It can be a solution to involve the community in waste bank activities, one of which is collecting waste together (crowdsourcing) so that waste can be collected more quickly and reporting locations where there are landfills. The design of this application's user interface uses the design thinking method and produces nine design solution features in the form of an interactive prototype named Klik Sampah. Usability Testing of the Klik Sampah application prototype was carried out based on ISO 9241-11 and obtained a score of 89.84%, which is included in category A (Excellent). This study also shows that user preferences for the Klik Sampah application design solution depend on the habits and amount of waste collected by each user.

Lagos city's land use and land cover (LU/LC) classes have changed dramatically in recent decades as a result of its continuing population growth and other human and anthropogenic activities. The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development must be adopted in order to preserve the available land cover classes in Lagos. Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals aims to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and long-term. The use of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to track the progress of SDG 11 is an essential strategy. Remote sensing and geographic information systems were used to model and analyze the data in this study. To achieve this aim, remotely sensed data, such as Landsat 7 ETM + and 8 OLI, was used to determine the rate of changes in Lagos from 2010 to 2020 by adopting the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and then project the likely changes that may occur by 2025 and 2030. Observed ground truthing information was adopted for validation and for checking the accuracy of the classification. The result shows that from 2010 to 2015 and to 2020, built-up area had increased from 11.73 % to 12.81 % and finally to 29.51 %, while agricultural land declined by 11.84 % to 3.37 % and then to 2.99 %. Water bodies and wetland percentages decreased from 19.00 % and 19.50 % in 2010 to 17.39 % and 8.48 % in 2015, and to 18.37 % and 16.92 % in 2020. Forest land and bare land classes have also changed from 25.4 % and 12.52 % in 2010, to 33.37 % and 24.58 % in 2015, and to 18.10 % and 14.11 % in 2020.

Furthermore, while the complex relations between health and the characteristics of built environments require system-orientated thinking and interdisciplinary interventions, they have—until recently—mainly been addressed with conventionally narrow sector-based (mostly technocratic) approaches (e.g., in regard to energy efficiency or carbon reduction). This paper, however, investigates how health co-benefits are perceived by stakeholders in the field of sustainable building in Vietnam. It examines empirical insights collected from a large-scale household survey—with a focus on a green building-certified project case study—conducted in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, six thematic webinars, and eleven expert interviews. Among other things, the paper points out a challenging mismatch between the high importance homebuyers place on green building health benefits, and the focus of stakeholders on energy-saving benefits, which are not necessarily the homebuyers’ most pressing concerns. Therefore, the paper concludes that improved health and well-being should be more strongly considered as co-benefits of green buildings. Equally important is that this paper also brings attention to the essential systemic approach in both academic and practical efforts toward the implementation of the SDG3, to “ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages”, and SDG 11, “to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”.","Green Building Certification; Green Building Movement; Health Co-benefits; Intersectoral Approach; Sdg 11; Sdg 3; Sustainable Building; Urban Health; Users’ Perspectives; Building; Certification; Household Survey; Perception; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Area; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165042718"

Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) proposes ideas to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This paper approaches this goal through land use, integrated into an effective connectivity network. It offers a scientific and systematic approach. The research employs Space Syntax of the University College London as a tool for urban analysis and the principles of Sustainable Street Networks developed by the Congress of New Urbanism to respond to connectivity issues. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs empirical research through case studies. A systematic literature review is conducted on the diversified applications of the Space Syntax correlations, which steered the fundamental analysis of the elements of deconstruction to structure and land use. Space Syntax and Sustainable Street Network characteristics were the essential research methods. It is important to note that these data a new finding on the Syntactic Maps of the two case study cities. Findings: The paper summarises a set of results on (1) international comparison of spatial intelligence, (2) patterns from the Eastern cases and (3) theoretical guidelines for spatial intelligence through the Syntax by offering key characteristics of the New Urbanism principles, which could be considered, while revitalising the cities in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Research limitations/implications: The findings are specific and applicable to the oriental contexts. However, such results have been further compared to the Western context. Practical implications: The study develops a toolkit for urban planners and designers and architects in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Social implications: The research has focused and will add value for SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Theoretically, the paper offers insights to urban design readers. Originality/value: It is important to note that the data itself is a new finding on Syntactic Maps of the two case study cities. The investigated setting is unique, and the first attempt in generating a Space Syntax map to the cities of Klang Valley, and the findings, therefore, offer a new set of knowledge-base to the city planners, urban designers, researchers and architects.","Connectivity; Land Use; Sdg; Space Syntax; Structure And Place; Sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149482913"

Thus, addressing the urban governance of informal settlements requires an inter/trans-disciplinary scope to reach a cross-cutting agenda that combines social/behavioral, economics, and public health with the built environment disciplines. Respectively, this paper aims to establish an integrative framework based upon a blended inter/trans-disciplinary approach of urban governance for informal settlements in Egypt. The study adopts a theoretical analytic methodology to achieve its aim by reviewing the literature on informal settlement policies. It argues that the inter/trans-disciplinarity approach contributes to integrative urban governance agendas that enhance the quality of life of informal settlements. While exploring three bottom-up perspectives of understanding the formation of informal urban settings—socioeconomic, morphological, and sociophysical—an integrative model is developed to allow a contextual perspective for examining informal domains. The model is articulated to guide the purpose of the multidimensional analysis methods for investigating informal contexts. An integrative agenda with six analysis tasks, each involving interdisciplinary group of academics, experts, stakeholders, and authorized representatives, is outlined by the method originated in this paper. Ultimately, and concerning aspects of sustainable urban cities, the paper introduces an integrative agenda that enables overcoming gaps in current upgrading practices when examining the informal settlements of the Egyptian contexts.","Egypt; Informal Settlements; Interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary Studies; Urban Governance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149231033"

This milestone reaffirms the nation’s sovereignty and signifies its financial autonomy and independence. However, elevation to middle-income status should not overshadow future challenges. Experts in the field have raised concerns that Bangladesh may become entrapped in the cycle of middle-income status, thereby impeding further advancement towards achieving developed-country status. To progress, the nation must formulate a comprehensive plan to attain developed country status by 2041. PURPOSE: Housing is considered a fundamental right for citizens in Bangladesh as per its constitution; however, a significant population in the capital city of Dhaka lives in overcrowded slums or lacks basic shelter altogether (Khasru et al., 2019). The SDGs recognise the need for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities for human settlements, particularly for the 1 billion slum dwellers worldwide, who often lack access to public transportation and suffer from poor air quality and solid waste problems. Many countries are implementing various projects to address these issues and meet the SDGs. Bangladesh is one of the few countries to implement the SDGs by the UN, achieving significant indicators even during and after the COVID pandemic; this was due to timely and systemic steps by the government and civil society organisations (CSOs). The primary objective of this paper is to examine the role of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) in promoting sustainable housing and its efforts in implementing sustainable housing practices within a city of 20 million people as a regulatory authority aligned with the SDGs. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study uses primary and secondary data to focus on sustainable housing conditions in Bangladesh’s capital city. The study will employ secondary data collection methods such as a literature survey, government document analysis, and archive exploration. To determine the role of the regulatory authority, the study will employ primary data collection methods such as semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Furthermore, the secondary literature review will determine the regulatory authority’s limitations in ensuring sustainable housing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. By employing such methods, the study will propose policy recommendations for better working conditions and improvements in service delivery by Bangladesh regulatory authorities. FINDINGS: To provide sustainable housing and implement SDG 11, various government agencies and CSOs work together in Dhaka. The Capital Development Authority (CDA), also known as Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), is the top organisation that makes policies and decisions to ensure the capital is sustainably inhabitable for current and future generations. However, the failure to collaborate with other government agencies, local government organisations, CSOs, and individual landowners has prevented RAJUK from implementing its significant policies, including the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for Dhaka (Ranjbari et al., 2021). To address the housing crisis and implement SDG 11 in Dhaka, it is essential to develop sustainable solutions. First, the government must ensure that policies are implemented collaboratively with all stakeholders. Second, it is crucial to incorporate affordable and eco-friendly housing designs, energy-efficient building materials, and proper waste management practices (Haque et al., 2022). Third, sustainable transportation options, such as mass rapid transit systems and bike-sharing programmes, must be developed. Fourth, the government must promote public awareness and community engagement through education campaigns and community-based approaches. Finally, partnerships with CSOs can help ensure the involvement of marginalised and vulnerable populations.","Detailed Area Plan; Housing; Liveable City; Sdgs; Sustainable Housing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211941465"

All around the world, slums are becoming the only option for low-income communities to settle within city boundaries. This paper presents a literature review aimed to provide a more detailed understanding of knowledge related to the literature on two things, namely slum upgrading and climate change adaptation of Low-Income Communities (LIC), and also on its interrelations. The literature review uses a semi-systematic methodology, using the web of science search engines combined with google scholar. We use keywords such as slum upgrading, climate adaptation, and participatory. The search engine proposed 482 papers, 75 as data and 66 public access journal articles. Out of these numbers, we narrow down the perimeters of research scope to 71 linked to SDGs. However, only 11 are relevant to urbanized areas. This finding shows that not much literature regarding these interrelations is produced. This review explains assumed interrelationships that influence each other and exist between slum upgrading on urban riversides and forms of adaptation to climate change in urban areas. The definition of slum upgrading is an integrated and comprehensive intervention aimed to improve the physical characteristics of the environment and its inhabitants quality of life, divided into in-situ and ex-situ efforts. Climate adaptation is a process rather than a program or pattern of action by the LIC in dealing with climate change impacts comprehensively and substantially within the context of social and environmental. Their interrelations of the two themes are the physical and non-physical efforts, but also on the participatory levels. Participation determines the level of climate resiliency for the LIC. Based on the descriptions of theories related to the theme of this research, there are propositions for the field study as follows. (1) slum upgrading with adaptation sensitivity to climate change will ultimately increase the resilience of low-income communities to be more prepared to face climate change. (2) The specificity of land ownership status and cultural strength can enrich locality and social closeness. (3) The level of community participation in slum upgrading affects the climate resiliency level of the LIC.","Climate Adaptation; Low-income Communities; Participatory; Slum Upgrading; Sustainable Development Goals","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180293002"

However, as urban migration increases globally, slum populations are outstripping cities’ capacity to provide accommodation for new residents and to deliver on their Agenda 2030 Goal 11 targets. To try and solve this problem, the temptation for city planners, urbanists and politicians is to design and build quickly and cheaply. These budget constraints often result in expensive projects that eventually fail to deliver on inclusiveness, safety, resilience, and sustainability. Recent advances in Computer Aided Design (CAD) and algorithm-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) allow design systems to be programmed with the successful built environment pattern elements described by the design code, thus generating buildings adapted to their precise location. Using these innovative techniques, a development solution for a slum area can be delivered which is more connected with the culture, climate, and aspirations of the local population.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178482762"

One example of such areas can be found in the South-West of Colombia, in the Las Piedras River sub-basin. The National Administrative Department of Statistics in Colombia (DANE in Spanish) aims at mapping the population and houses in dispersed and difficult-to-access rural settlements in an accurate and continuous way.

Among the different targets it aims to promote a participatory and integrated transport-land planning; to guarantee accessibility to green areas and safe and inclusive public spaces, especially to vulnerable users; to ensure access to safe and economic living spaces and transport systems. This work presents an integrated approach to consider the role of Green Infrastructures (GIs) and Transport Mobility (TM) as key components in the transition towards a model of sustainable and resilient cities. The analysis of these two components of the urban system, especially in cities with high rates of motorisation and traffic congestion, on the one hand, and with a non-widespread presence of green areas, on the other, becomes strategic for implementing actions aimed at making cities more sustainable. The analyzed case study focuses on Catania (Italy) at different territorial levels, considering both the urban area and the neighboring municipalities. The study consists of two steps: (i) first, an interview-based methodology has been implemented to analyze citizen’s perception of GIs to tackle climate change and the willingness to pay to sustain the maintenance of these infrastructures; (ii) on the other hand, an extended survey will be performed to evaluate the propensity of users towards innovative shared transport systems and also the willingness to pay for the service. The obtained results from the first round of interviews highlighted the citizens point of view linked to GIs and their interest in the co-management.

This goal emphasises making human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The progress achieved towards the targets that articulate this goal is constantly monitored through a system of indicators. However, this process is complex, especially for those targets that concern the quality of the policies intended to guide development phenomena. This is the case with SDG11.a, which aims to «Support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning» and therefore regards territorial governance activities. In a recent contribution, the authors explored the contents and implications of SDG11.a and developed a system of procedural, instrumental, and financial indicators aimed at evaluating the quality of territorial governance. This paper operationalises some of these indicators concerning a real territorial context-the Metropolitan City of Turin-to reflect on their practicability and the added value they can provide in decision-making and monitoring. The work results show how any measurement of the quality of territorial governance remains inherently linked to the institutional characteristics of the context and the actual availability of data and information. This undoubtedly complicates the use of the indicators proposed in a comparative perspective; however, their application can promote critical reflections by public authorities and the development of more effective policies.","Agenda 2030; Indicators; Metropolitan Area; Sdg11.a; Sustainable Development; Territorial Governance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163713813"

Using remote sensing technologies, this study aims to enhance methodologies for mapping and monitoring changes in terrestrial Landcover resources in Thailand’s Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai National Park. The goal is to investigate and develop a remote sensing technique for classifying terrestrial Landcover by compensating for topographic effects. Changes were detected using the Landsat 5-TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellites, and deviations from solar and terrain were rectified before the satellite imagery was identified using a Random Forest classifier. It improves efficiency in identifying terrestrial forest regions by combining high-level numerical modelling data (Digital Elevation Model: DEM) with it. The results showed that in the Khao Yai National Park area, the extraction of terrestrial Landcover areas using Long-term Landsat satellite photos performed significantly, with an accuracy of 82.05 percent. The goal of this study is to leverage the power of AI to make the best use of a wide range of terrestrial forest resources. This includes the significance of conducting a comprehensive evaluation of legislation governing the management of terrestrial forest resources.","Artificial Intelligence; Land Use; Landcover; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Smart City; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151121103"

Sustainable Development Goal #11—Sustainable cities and human settlements—is to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. “Providing adequate shelter for all” is the first objective of Chap. 7 of Agenda 21. Localization, defined in paragraph 89 of the 2030 agenda, is linked to the experience and leadership of a “wide range of stakeholders” and “inclusive processes”. Through this “bottom-up” approach local needs and methods for realizing sustainable affordable housing can be accomplished. Integrative and regenerative design frameworks are applied to simultaneously address holistic housing design and leadership skills necessary to contribute to sustainable development projects. This paper presents an iterative university-community partnership for housing, new and retrofit, that is responsible to the residents and the community. It brings together two university-based research centers, three entities responsible for providing affordable housing in a community underserved in this market, and students from multiple disciplines across the university. The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon Design Challenge, an annual intercollegiate competition dedicated to “build[ing] a global community of current and future professionals,” attracts continuous student engagement. The collaboration and partnerships forged ensure local impact. Multidisciplinary, cross-college curricular and extra-curricular initiatives engaging students with project clients and professionals to gain experience in integrative regenerative design practices are described. Students are central to capacity building and longevity of the program and partnerships.

Not in Education, Employment, or Training [NEET] are among those most affected by this social invisibility. Nevertheless, these young people are not alienated or lost. Far from it. Instead, some of them found in the arts registered in the community—music, dance, photography and graffiti—a possibility to resist the various social stigmas attached on them. This was the view on which we conducted our artistic and social intervention, based on the innovative “arts-based research” methodology and “youth-led participatory research,” called “The Neighborhood is Ours II!,” with young NEETs in the socially underprivileged Cerco neighborhood of Porto in Portugal in 2022. We propose a theoretical-empirical approach around a visual/narrative sociology—namely using digital cinema—which will be based on a short film about the life narrative of a young NEET, who has used artistic practices to establish himself in the city of Porto as a cultural mediator. Thus—through these processes of co-creation of knowledge (cine-making)- we aim to demonstrate how the use of the arts can be a key tool in promoting social inclusion and reducing/minimizing feelings of insecurity, but also act as a means of resistance to the daily adversities experienced by marginalized young people and, of course, demonstrate the ways in which the use of artistic practices plays a pivotal role in the development of sustainable and alternative professional, social futures and citizenship.","Arts-based Research; Biopolitics Of Social Inclusion; Cerco Neighborhood; Citizenship; Community Inclusion; Digital Cinema; Neets; Youth-led Participatory Research","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144225416"

This paper focuses specifically on SDG-11 “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” and how cities are increasingly incorporating ICT toward this goal. The public discourse on Smart Cities suggests economic, social and environmental benefits are possible through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). However, the increased deployment and use of digital infrastructure and processes in the name of sustainability and optimization itself is the focus of a growing body of critical literature on Smart Cities. This mini-review collates critical literature on digital infrastructures and processes related to SDG-11 and Smart Cities to identify areas of significance for further research. Although many Smart City projects discuss sustainability benefits, the distribution of benefits and risks across different communities is rarely examined. An increased use of ICT in Smart City projects can provide environmental benefits to some communities, while shifting the burden of risks to other communities. An increased use of ICT has its own energy and resource impacts that has implications for sustainability beyond the geography of individual cities to global impacts. The lifecycle and supply chain impacts of advanced ICT projects are being identified and documented. The end user of the Smart City projects may benefit significantly from the increased use of ICTs, while the environmental costs are often borne by disparate communities. In some cases, within the same city where a Smart City project is deployed, the inequities in distribution of environmental resources and services are exacerbated by layering new ICT implementations on top of existing socio-economic inequities. Therefore, this paper combines a broad view of Smart City environmental impacts, as well as a deep examination of the intersection of social justice and environmental justice issues to create more wholistic approaches for analysis of governance of Smart City projects. A more wholistic approach for governance of Smart City projects is required that includes combined social justice and environmental justice frameworks, toward achievement of SDG-11 goals.","Environmental Justice; Ict; Sdg-11; Smart Cities; Social Justice; Sustainable Cities; Sustainable Communities; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs)","Short survey","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143911608"

SDG Goal 11 is one of 17 comprehensive SDGs, and it pays specific attention to making “cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. This study comparatively analyzes the current state of participatory urban planning processes in three cities: Chicago, Illinois, U.S.; São Paulo, Brazil; and Delhi, India. Utilizing the cities’ most recent master plans, a content analysis found that public engagement was a key instrument that they adopted in the production of their planning documents, but the level of engagement and tools used to engage the public differed among cities, with Chicago and São Paulo demonstrating more robust public engagement than Delhi. The historical context of the comparative countries’ political, cultural, and socioeconomic development also plays a role in the degree to which a landscape for public engagement and participation exists. The study finds that the ideals of a just city can be determined by the level of participation with which cities engage their citizens during the planning process, and that sustainable urban development is further determined by the level of social equity that currently exists in a city itself.","Comparative Social Equity; Participatory Planning; Social Equity; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Planning; Comparative Study; Equity; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Urban Development; Urban Planning; Urban Population; Brazil; Chicago; Delhi; Illinois; India; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140637062"

This means that every Country must commit to facing the challenge of increasingly welcoming and barrier-free cities, providing 'universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities'. The mission of inclusive play is to create accessible and sensory-rich play environments that meet the widest range of users and abilities offering several and stimulating play opportunities in the same setting. In many playgrounds of our cities, for persons with disabilities, accessing, moving and making play experiences is not easy, in some cases it is not possible. The paper presents the results of a study carried out in order to investigate the inclusiveness of outdoor playgrounds and introduces the need of new perspectives towards a new and innovative view of inclusive playgrounds. The development process of the checklist for assessing the inclusiveness of outdoor playgrounds involved four steps. Step 1: Definition of the main concepts of investigation and generation of the items on the basis of the relevant literature and best practices. Step 2: Scaling and scoring. Step 3: Pilot test to verify the real applicability of the checklist. Step 4: Design of the final checklist. The final checklist was applied to a sample of playgrounds belonging to an Italian urban area selected as a case study in order to make a picture of the state of the art of the playgrounds built in recent years. After the checklist application, the processing of the collected data shows that there is still much to be done to make urban play areas fully accessible and usable by all. Physical accessibility (not always guaranteed) to the play area and to the play components is not enough. Currently there are few playgrounds that ensure inclusive experiences by offering a wide range of equipment with different game values and levels of challenge and services that can be used by everyone. Inclusive playgrounds in our communities are still a small percentage compared to all existing play environments, although there is a greater attention to the theme from year to year. The importance of inclusive playgrounds is recognized by everyone at a theoretical level, but in practice it is still necessary to promote, implement and verify the culture of accessibility and inclusive play. If we want inclusive cities, it is necessary to find skills and resources as well as effective operational tools to map the critical issues of existing playgrounds and to implement restyling interventions or new projects of successful and comprehensive inclusive play environments.","Accessibility And Usability; Inclusive Play; Playground; Accessibility And Usability; Barrier-free; Green Spaces; Human Settlements; Inclusive Play; Persons With Disabilities; Playground; Social Inclusion; Un General Assembly; Universal Access; Sustainable Development; Aged; Attention; Checklist; City; Conference Paper; Disabled Person; Human; Skill; Social Inclusion; Theoretical Study; Urban Area; Usability; Article","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137521203"

Although most Italian museums have been forced to comply with the rules for accessibility in public spaces since 1971 following Law 30/3/1971 n. 118 and, more recently, Legislative Decree 81/2008, in this context, Universal Design can contribute to the achievement of these goals by improving accessibility to spaces, services, and the community's well-being on the one hand, along with providing a deeper comprehension and awareness of the informational processes on the other hand. In this regard, museum organizations play a critical role in enhancing the quality of life and society's education by preserving and distributing cultural heritage over time. Despite the large number of studies focused on museum organizations, there is little research that takes into account Universal Design and its macro-and firm-level economic benefits on museum institutions (not-for-profit, public, and private). Considering this research gap, this study's aim is twofold: 1) to explore how some Italian museums have actually improved their facilities and services according to Universal Design principles and 2) to assess the economic museum accessibility. A qualitative methodology was applied using a questionnaire delivered to eight Italian museum, and collected data was compared. The findings underline how museums' investments in Universal Design may produce relevant economic benefits, both on the macroeconomic and firm levels, providing guidelines for public policies concerning welfare, transport, environment, education, and well-being. Universal Design principles can lead museums to an increasing convergence toward Sustainable Development Goals, improving their overall economic performance as well as strengthening their role in a more aware and participative society. This study has several relevant implications in terms of both policy and management. Policymakers should promote Universal Design investments in museums in order to ensure accessibility to a greater number of visitors, and cultural institutions should consider accessibility as a specific key management dimension to be monitored and improved.","Cultural Heritage; Economic Benefits; Museum; Sustainable Development Goals; Universal Design; Economic And Social Effects; Historic Preservation; Planning; Public Policy; Sustainable Development; Cultural Heritages; Design Principles; Economic Benefits; Economic Impacts; Human Settlements; Public Space; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Universal Design; Well Being; Museums; Conference Paper; Controlled Study; Education; Human; Human Experiment; Information Center; Inheritance; Investment; Practice Guideline; Profit; Public Policy; Questionnaire; Sustainable Development Goal; Universal Design; Welfare; Wellbeing; Article","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137484037"

An exponential increase in the urban population has been observed since the mid-20th century. As expected by the United Nations (UN), by the year 2050, 68.4% of the world population will live in cities with a population of 20,000 or more. Due to enormous socio-economic pressures resulting from population expansion, urbanization and intensive changes in the landscape, an urban development program to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable has become of the utmost importance since the 2005 World Summit in Rio and further adopted in 2015 by UN as the ""2030 Agenda""for Sustainable Development. The study focused on monitoring the SDG 11 target 11.3.1. they are defined as a ratio of land consumption rate to the population growth rate because mapping urban land quickly and accurately is indispensable for watershed run-off prediction and other planning applications. There is no well-established, consistent way to measure either urban land sprawl or population growth. However, remote sensing methods and satellite-derived data make it possible to monitor urban growth rates over large areas in a relatively short time. There are many techniques for urban land cover automatically mapping. These techniques can be broadly grouped into two general types: those based on the input data classification, including pixel- and object-based classifications and those based on directly segmenting the indices, such as the commonly used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized build-up area index (NDBI), and their modifications. The authors used classical pixel (supervised classification with Spectral Angle Mapper classification and KNN methods) and objectbased classification in the presented research. In addition, spectral indices, i.e., NDVI, NDBI and their modifications to derive buildup areas, were applied. Moreover, the authors focused on the recent deep learning and machine learning methods, i.e., the utilization of spatial-context information in multi-temporal data to learn hierarchical feature representations. All methods of detecting built-up areas were compared and assessed based on the available cartographic data.","Classification; Cnn; Sustainable Development; Urban Areas; Urban Growth; Deep Learning; Mapping; Pixels; Planning; Population Statistics; Remote Sensing; Supervised Learning; Sustainable Development; Urban Growth; Area Index; Built-up Areas; Cnn; Earth's Surface; Growth Monitoring; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Remote-sensing; United Nations; Urban Areas; Classification (of Information)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131948886"

Whereas SDG11 targets are paired with one or more indicators to monitor their achievement, in some cases this process is not straightforward. In particular, when it comes to Target 11.a Support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning, the identified indicator does not seem able to grasp the complexity of national and regional governance, policy and planning. With the aim to contribute to this concern, the paper conceptually discusses the contents and implications of the SDG11 target 11.a. On this basis, it develops a multi-dimensional set of indicators to assess the quality of spatial governance and planning in a given context, and divides them into three main categories: (i) procedural indicators, (ii) instrumental indicators and (iii) financial indicators.

Urban refugee spaces are often segregated in the form of colonies, ethnic villages, even ghettos, embodying institutionalised discourses of apathy and violence. These spaces only occupy the cracks and margins of the normative, formal city, as appropriations of inhospitable natural terrains and urban systems. The paper discusses how refugees compete for resources for survival as ""bio-political"" subjects and are often held summarily responsible for causing ecological stress in host environments. After the 194 7 Partition of the Indian subcontinent, millions of Hindu Bengali refugees from East Pakistan flooded the Eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura. Kolkata particularly drew millions for better livelihood prospects. Facing government apathy and local violence, East-Bengali refugees appropriated the urban fringes of Kolkata and claimed their right to urban space through the political act of squatting or Jabar-Dakhal. The intent of this paper is to investigate and map the spatial distribution of East-Bengali refugee squatters and elaborate on how they transformed the terrain and distributed resources through self-management tactics. This spatial history casestudy attempts to uncover locational data from archival government records, existing academic literature and fieldwork to visualise where the 145 pre-1950 and the 123 post-1950 Jabar-Dakhal colonies were located in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. This case of successful refugee self-settlement is qualitatively read in relation to the major areas of ecological stress in Kolkata. One of the UN sustainable development goals is to make cities and human settlements 'inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable'. This paper hopes to encourage further studies of urban refugee selfsettlement and local integration as a viable but complex socio-political-environmental process.","Global South; Jabar-dakhal Colony; Post-partition Kolkata; Refugee Seif-settlement; Urban Ecology; Vulnerability","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184316194"

The majority of covid-19 cases are from urban areas demonstrating the urgent need for improving cities’ resiliency to prepare for pandemics. The urban sustainable development goal (SDG) 11, namely, “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” depicts the importance of resilient cities and resilient urban transportation system as well. Urban resilience is defined as urban system’s ability to absorb shocks (sudden social, economic, or environmental changes), to adapt to changes, and transform into a new system when coping becomes difficult in the current existing form. The urban transportation system needs to be resilient to deal with pandemics, natural, and biological hazards. The transportation system also supports pandemic propagation such as covid-19 through associated local and long-distance travel risks. Generally, long-distance travel introduces disease into a non-affected community, and the local travel disperses it. A resilient urban transportation system would lead to a resilient city and decrease the negative impacts of pandemic and other calamities such as urban floods, climate risks, etc. Hence it is of utmost importance to evaluate the level of resilience of the urban transportation system and understand how a resilient and sustainable urban transportation system helps in achieving SDG 11. The objectives of the chapter are to; identify how urban transportation connects with SDG 11, develop a framework of indicators to evaluate the resilience of the urban transportation system and its association with SDG 11, and highlight how the resilient urban transportation system would cope with disasters. To develop an indicator framework, indicators are examined from relevant literature. Further, the chapter includes measurements for selected indicators. The above indicator framework would help practitioners and policymakers in the selection of suitable transportation interventions.","Indicator Framework; Resilience; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Transport; Urban Transportation System","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159008790"

LECs are contextualized in the broader framework of the energy revolution started after Paris Agreements in December 2015 that led to the definition of 17 “sustainable development goals (SDGs)” by United Nations (UN) and to the establishment of the Clean Energy Package by European Commission in 2019. At global level, Energy Communities play a pivotal role to achieve United Nations SDG 7 (“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”) and 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”), the former more focused on rural communities and the latter more focused on urban context. This is even more true if thinking that reducing energy poverty, by bringing clean and affordable energy in rural areas through hybrid energy systems, is a fundamental strategy to develop rural contexts while also reducing migration toward urban areas and megacities. At European level, Energy Communities have a fundamental role in a consumer-centered energy system in which consumers and prosumers are fully engaged and play an active role both in single and in aggregated forms also with new forms of citizen participation (citizen energy communities). Indeed, LECs provide the right framework for increasing awareness, engagement, and empowerment of citizens in the energy sector. Moreover, LECs can be considered as multi-energy environments in which different energy systems and vectors can be integrated in order to optimally exploit the synergies among energy and non-energy networks (e.g. water distribution network and desalination systems). This is even more true when dealing with “geographical” or “energy” islands in which local energy communities are well identified by geographical or network boundaries. In the second part of the chapter, the authors will provide a vision on how the technologies and systems presented in this book, implemented in local multi-energy communities, can support the achievement of goal of a transition toward carbon-neutral energy systems. Finally, the authors present a vision for the future role of LECs in the energy transition, starting from the experience of European Green Deal.","Citizen Energy Communities; Consumer Empowerment; European Green Deal; Local Energy Communities; Local Integrated Energy Systems; Renewable Energy Communities","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146903491"

Within this goal, Target 11.4 aims to “strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural heritage”. In Europe, inside cathedrals, churches in general, common buildings, castles, towers and palaces the role played by curved masonry and wood structures, in the form of arches, vaults and domes are among the most well recognized. Arches are also very common and of major importance in Roman and Medieval bridges, as well as in aqueducts. The evolution from trilithons to arches, passing through corbel vaults was a Roman intuition; the further refinement of the idea, achieved in the Middle Age and Renaissance, to conceive structures resistant thanks to their geometry led in Europe to build double curvature structures and domes with impressive artistic value. There is an imperative need to ensure that these outstanding structures continue to be an integral part of local life, given the increasing level of support and expertise required to maintain them at a time when the limited resources in communities are becoming ever more stretched.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142679256"

From the methods for demonstrating virtual environments in the laboratory, to the methods for studying psychological and physiological responses in actual urban nature, these are the means used to validate the relationship between “nature and health benefits.” In the previous chapter, we explored theories of nature and people. Based on evolution and psycho-physiological concepts, it appears that people prefer nature with specific characteristics that provide “something” good for them, either by supporting their living needs, setting their cognitive ability to a good emotional state, or by making them feel satisfied. In this chapter, we selected the methods for performing health benefit experiments, psychological scales for collecting human responses in different environments, and physiological instruments used to record people’s responses in order to verify these theories from another perspective, including empirical research to conceive readers that nature provides better health benefits than urban. The following existing tools for examining the psychological to physical responses in each section contains a brief introduction of the methods or tools, the operation process and indicators of each apparatus, and relevant researches that lead us to think about what those selective review of tools and concepts in psychological and physiological human response-to-nature researches could support the SDGs on Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and Goal 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable).

This work shows how the concept of chorematic maps can be useful to make easier the understanding of urban planning and its connections with mental wellbeing of citizens. To do so, a new set of chorems is introduced, designed to describe the qualities and elements of the urban environment that can influence the happiness, and consequently, the mental wellbeing. The work shows an example of the application of the proposed chorems in an urban environment, highlighting how they can be used both by experts and ordinary citizens, making it possible to exploit them as a means to encourage both administrators, technicians, and citizens to live and deal with their city with greater awareness and participation.","Chorems; Geovisual Analytics; Smart Communities; Urban Planning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138653984"

Industrial and systems engineers often lead or play a major role in selecting the optimal site for a new facility and then in the design, construction, and commissioning of the new operations. ISEs have long used tools to optimize the location of a facility based on factors like cost, the location of suppliers, the location of customers, etc. With the advent of sustainability, we have been asked to incorporate new factors like the environmental impact and the social impact of the new facilities. Traditional methods and optimization criteria have often led to new facilities that have had devastating environmental, health and economic effects on communities of color, rural “poverty pockets,” and economically impoverished Native-American reservations. Environmental justice initiatives seek to not only level the playing field but take into consideration the exiting impacts of past decisions when proposing new facilities that may increase the burden on these under-served populations.

SDG 11 is accompanied by ten time-bound targets directed towards making cities and human settlements across the world inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by 2030. Reports reveal that Zimbabwe, among other countries, is struggling to give effect to these targets, including Target 11.6 which requires local authorities to contribute towards reducing ‘the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities’. Struggling with this target has implications for the enjoyment of environmental rights, among other fundamental rights. As such, using a human rights-based approach, this article explores how the right to a healthy environment entrenched in the 2013 Constitution of Zimbabwe can be used to pursue Target 11.6. Although the huge potential of the human rights-based approach remains untapped in Zimbabwe, the article argues that its adoption in relation to Target 11.6 appears, in theory, to be the most appropriate means for the enjoyment of the right to a healthy environment as local authorities have a shared responsibility to adhere to human rights norms and standards. In light of the commendable precedents set by the judiciary in some cases, local authorities are recommended to consider the implication of legal provisions on the right to a healthy environment in the process of exercising their legislative or executive powers directed towards the realisation of Target 11.6.","Constitution Of Zimbabwe; Human Rights-based Approach; Local Authorities; Right To A Healthy Environment; Sdg 11; Target 11.6; Zimbabwe","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134696135"

But, research on these topics is still limited and not available for many cities in the world. To fill this gap, we present this thematic issue “From Smart Urban Forests to Edible Cities: New Approaches in Urban Planning and Design.” The findings from this thematic issue offer new insight to policymakers and practitioners, as well as contribute to the emerging literature on edible and forest cities. Furthermore, the findings spanning different cities from different geographies can be used towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals of making cities and human settlements more resilient, inclusive, safe, and sustainable, as well as ending hunger, achieving food security, and improving nutrition.

Improving the personal security conditions in relation to the occurrence of predatory crimes or incivility, as well as the perception related to such events, is an important necessity in response to the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda and more specifically SDG 11 ‒ Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The proposed research addresses the issue through a quantitative model of crime risk assessment. Specifically, the model is substantiated through a spatially explicit composite crime risk index, I<inf>Rc</inf>, which allows to analyse the criticalities of the territory, highlighting their intensity and surface extension through a crime risk map. Such an index varies significantly over time, as well as varying in space, since the variables involved are extremely dynamic. In order to control this aspect, the paper proposes the construction of a parametric model in a GIS environment with a double purpose. The first one is to automate the implementation of the crime risk map construction procedure and make it replicable in any context and at any scale. The second is to control the whole procedure in order to explore the parameters in relation to which risk levels vary most significantly. The usefulness of such a model lies in the opportunity to simulate different risk scenarios to be used as additional knowledge in the ex-ante phase of urban Plan formation in order to evaluate the proposed planning choices.","Crime Risk; Parametric Model; Urban Planning; Maps; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Sustainable Development; Urban Planning; Condition; Crime Risk; Human Settlements; Parametric Models; Personal Security; Risk Maps; Risks Scenarios; Sustainable Cities; Sustainable Communities; Urban Security; Crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126243781"

Among them, Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11), “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”, can be measured at the city level. So far SDG11 still lacks three-quarters of the data required to accurately assess progress towards the goal. In this paper, we localized the indicators of SDG11 and collected Earth observation data, statistical data, and monitoring data at the city and county levels to build a better urban sustainable development assessment framework.

There is a need for government, industry and research institutions to work together. Research and innovation can be used to: formulate good policies, create new materials, improve the efficiency of local building materials, create jobs, understand population dynamics, evolve an integrated approach to housing infrastructure and formulate new functional designs for housing infrastructure. Product-driven research is strongly recommended in order to achieve the desired improvement of the housing and urban development sector. There is also a need for adequate funding for research and innovation by government and private sector.

The study evaluated the performance of urban community gardens in order to verify their potential for implementation in the slums of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Significant assets and drawbacks were analyzed from existing studies and categorized into social, spatial, economic and environmental factors. Additionally, qualitative interviews on societal and motivational issues were conducted with contributors to a community garden in Dresden, Germany. The results highlight the potential of urban gardening to counteract spatial pressures in informal areas by creating green spaces, improving food quality, raising environmental awareness and, in general, ensuring a higher quality of life. On the other hand, some obstacles remain to be overcome, such as soil pollution, the high probability of further contamination as well as a lack of basic infrastructure. A top-down implementation of urban gardens within slums is considered feasible if the projects are designed in partnership with the community, and a long-term adaptive management model is applied.

They are re-sponsible for more than 70% of global carbon emissions. Many of these cities are experiencing dan-gerous levels of pollution, underemployment, and health disparities. Since 2015, 193 countries have endorsed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), intended to help address a wide ranlge of challenges affecting cities and ultimately secure the resources for their next generations. All states are expected to present the national progress towards the SDGs through a Voluntary National Review (VNR). Despite the importance of the cities within this framework, only a handful of them worldwide have actively begun to review and assess progress towards these SDGs on a city scale. This paper seeks to develop a Voluntary Local Review (VLR) framework to assess and evaluate the progress of cities towards contributing to the SDGs. This framework has been developed by localizing the international and national frameworks to measure the performance of cities as they ad-vance towards achieving the SDGs. Such a framework can serve as a tool for benchmarking progress on different aspects of sustainable development and help urban planners and policymakers priori-tize policies and actions to improve urban quality of life. This framework is applied to monitor and evaluate the progress of the city of Buraidah in Saudi Arabia, as it strives towards achieving the targets of SDG11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”).","Localization; Monitoring Framework; Sdg11; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Urban Observatory; Voluntary Local Review (vlr); Benchmarking; Human Settlement; Policy Making; Prioritization; Sustainable Development; Urban Planning; Saudi Arabia; Varanidae","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113929156"

It is urgent to study the environmental pathogenic factors and transmission route of it. We want to discuss the relationship between the urban living environment and the number of confirmed cases at the community scale, and examine the driving forces of community infection (e.g., environment, ecology, convenience, livability, and population density). Besides, we hope that our research will help make our cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. 650 communities with confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan were selected as the research objects. We utilize deep learning semantic segmentation technology to calculate the Visible Green Index (VGI) and Sky View Factor (SVF) of street view and use Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to study the driving forces of pandemic situation. Temperature and humidity information recorded by sensors was also used for urban sensing. We find that the more SVF has a certain inhibitory effect on the virus transmission, but contrary to our intuitive perception, higher VGI has a certain promotion effect. Also, the structural equation model constructed in this paper can explain the variance of 28.9% of the number of confirmed cases, and results (path coef.) demonstrate that residential density of community (0.517) is a major influencing factor for pandemic cases, whereas convenience of community living (0.234) strongly influence it. Communities with good suitability of community human settlement (e.g., construction time, price) are safer in the face of pandemic events. Does the influence of SVF and VGI on the results of the pandemic situation mean that sunlight can effectively block the spread of the virus? This spatial heterogeneity in different communities is helpful for us to explore the environmental transmission route of COVID-19.","Covid-19; Gis; Pls-sem; Sensor; Social Sensing; Street View; Deep Learning; Least Squares Approximations; Population Statistics; Semantics; Covid-19; Driving Forces; Green Indices; Partial Least-squares; Sensor; Sky View Factor; Social Sensing; Street View; Structural Equation Models; Transmission Route; Viruses; Disease Incidence; Disease Transmission; Epidemic; Gis; Habitat Structure; Health Status; Inhibitor; Living Standard; Pandemic; Residential Location; Urban Area; China; Hubei; Wuhan","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104726607"

This goal is particularly important in global cities where public places are shared with diverse communities. The successful design of shared, sustainable, and comfortable public places is, therefore, key to an inclusive and resilient urban future. Thermal comfort levels have proven to be a pre-requisite to the successful usage of public places, given their significant effect on their users' experience. However, in global multicultural cities, providing thermally comfortable public places is challenged by the diversity of their users. This paper aims to identify the effect of cultural diversity and climatic background of urban places' users on both their thermal perceptions and comfort levels. Field measurements were conducted in parallel to structured questionnaire and observations to interlink the empirical micrometeorological data with the subjective human assessments. The field empirical measurements took place during summer and winter alongside a total of 2123 valid questionnaires and observations at two selected case studies in Melbourne, Australia. Statistically significant variations in thermal sensation votes and thermal adaptation factors were found to be related to the users' cultural and climatic backgrounds. These findings showed the effect of the users’ cultural and climatic background on their thermal sensation votes, and, thus that it is crucial for these parameters to be taken into consideration while designing urban places within multicultural communities.","Cultural Diversity; Outdoor Thermal Comfort; Physiological Equivalent Temperature; Thermal Adaptation; Thermal Comfort Benchmarks; Surveys; Australia; Cultural Diversity; Melbourne; Outdoor Thermal Comfort; Physiological Equivalent Temperatures; Public Places; Thermal; Thermal Adaptation; Thermal Comfort Benchmark; Urban Places; Thermal Comfort; Adaptive Management; Climate Effect; Perception; Sustainable Development Goal; Temperature Effect; Urban Design; Victoria [australia]","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102314771"

Consequently, this study interrogates: (1) the growing use of city labels in the scientific literature over three decades; (2) the conceptual dimensions of individual city labels and their mutual interdependencies; and (3) likely future trajectories. This is accomplished through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 35 city labels: we examine their (co-)occurrences during 1990–2019 based on 11337 articles harvested in Scopus; analyse their conceptual associations drawing on a corpus of 22820 author keywords; and make a future forecast based on logistic growth modelling (the underlying datasets are available through open access). The findings significantly take forward recent bibliometric research by demonstrating: the rapid growth in scientific outputs; the diversification of city labels beyond ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’; and the evolution of an intricate conceptual field made up of different constellations of city labels. The findings have implications for urban policy and practice: regarding ongoing concerns about how to achieve synergies, rather than trade-offs, between SDGs, the conceptual field points to possible ways for relating SDG 11 to other dimensions of sustainable development. More broadly, the clarification of individual city labels’ conceptual underpinnings should help policymakers and practitioners make considered choices when mobilizing city labels in support of urban transformation efforts.","Bibliometrics; Cities; City Label; Smart City; Sustainable City; Sustainable Development; Economic And Social Effects; Planning; Urban Growth; Bibliometric Analysis; Human Settlements; Scientific Literature; Scientific Output; Sustainable Cities; Sustainable Urban Development; Transformation Effort; Urban Governance; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100057607"

Cities on the path to a sustainable future are expected in terms of SDG 11 to invest in public infrastructure to provide services to local communities in a sustainable manner. Due to limited fiscal space, urban local authorities in Zimbabwe, as elsewhere, would have to harness private sector participation in infrastructure investment through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to transition to a sustainable future. This article interrogates the extent to which the constitutional, legislative and policy frameworks in Zimbabwe enable urban local authorities to adopt and implement PPPs in order to achieve their mandate and by extension to realise local sustainability as envisaged in terms of SDG 11. The analysis reveals varied results about the potential of PPPs to contribute towards local sustainability in Zimbabwe. It is further argued that the legal framework underpinning PPPs has some generic features that could enhance their relevance and potential in the pursuit of sustainable cities in Zimbabwe.","Constitution Of Zimbabwe; Public-private Partnerships; Sdg 11; Sustainable Cities; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Local Authorities; Urbanisation; Zimbabwe","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112520947"

One way to accomplish these is to obtain reliable and updated information about the land cover characteristics of an area in the form of a map which can be done using remote sensing and machine learning. However, the practice of using these technologies for urban land cover mapping was observed to occur in the geographic locality level, and in the case of the Philippines, this is a domain that needs to be further explored to quantitatively comprehend urban extent. In this study, a map of man-made structures or built-up areas and natural structures or nonbuilt-up areas was generated over Quezon City and nearby surrounding areas where rapid rise in population occurs along with urban development. In addition, since related previous studies used various machine learning algorithms in doing the classification, this study compared the performances of three algorithms specifically random forest classifier, k-nearest neighbors, and Gaussian mixture model to identify which performed best in this particular application. The satellite imagery of the area of interest was collected from the Sentinel-2 mission satellites. All the three algorithms attained high accuracies across all measurements with small variations but greatly differed in the time consumed doing the classification. The highest over-all accuracy of 99.32% was obtained using random forest classifier despite taking the longest time to finish the classification, next is 98.95% using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm which also ranked second in terms of speed of classification, and last is 97.17% using the Gaussian mixture model despite being the fastest to complete the classification. Further studies may explore other machine learning algorithms as well as deep learning techniques to harness their capabilities in feature extraction for more complex applications. Aside from Sentinel-2, other satellite missions may also be utilized as sources of satellite imageries which can offer different spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions that would fit a specific application.","Gaussian Mixture Model; K-nearest Neighbors; Land Cover Map; Machine Learning; Random Forest Classifier; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Sentinel-2; Urbanization; Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Gaussian Distribution; Image Classification; Learning Algorithms; Motion Compensation; Nearest Neighbor Search; Object Recognition; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Gaussian Mixture Model; Land Cover Maps; Machine Learning Algorithms; Performances Analysis; Philippines; Random Forest Classifier; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Urban Land-cover; Urbanization; K-nearest Neighbors","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127586705"

This study was conducted by case studies on slum settlements in Trimulyo Village and Mangkang Wetan Village, Semarang city, Central Java Province, Indonesia, to formulate a slum upgrading model based on the resilience level of coastal communities towards climate change. The analysis included identifying the characteristics of slum settlements, scoring analysis to determine the resilience level possessed by coastal communities, and analysis of pentagon assets used to formulate slum upgrading models. The results of the study showed that these two research areas had a moderate level of vulnerability, with several different characteristics of asset ownership, particularly those related to human and social assets. Increasing the quality of human resources and social relations in the community was more intensified in the environment and community in Trimulyo, while improving the physical quality of the environment through housing improvements was carried out in Mangkang Wetan.","Coastal Community; Slum Upgrading; Vulnerability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122997464"

Between 1990 and 2015, the rate of urbanisation has increased from 33.9 to 57.1% and is projected to continue increasing as rural poverty continues to manifest itself. Urbanisation brings with it massive pressure in terms of service provision in the form of jobs, housing and other social infrastructure, physical infrastructure such as roads and electricity. With the focus put on ensuring that the urban areas are functional, orderly, and convenient in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable), the plight of people with disability, what Chipungu and Magidimisha refer to as the “invisible class” largely goes unnoticed. With poverty levels increasing in most urban areas, the number of vulnerable and disadvantaged people will also increase and with it, the challenges of making the urban areas as inclusive as possible. This chapter seeks to have a deeper understanding of the challenges that people with disability are facing as cities struggle with inclusivity. The paper will combine both primary and secondary data which will be collected through key informant discussions with the city officials, institutions and organisations that work with people living with disabilities and the people living with disabilities themselves. Data will also be collected through direct observation in areas where people with disabilities frequent. The data collected will be analysed and used to develop strategies that can be used by cities and other urban local authorities to ensure that the dream to make cities truly inclusive is realised.","Disability; Inclusive Cities; Inclusivity; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116461192"

The analysis is placed within the urban resilience framework. The Post-2015 development agenda is committed to ‘make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’ (SDG 11). For this chapter, urban resilience means the ability of a system, entity, community, or person to adapt to a variety of changing conditions and to withstand shocks while still maintaining its essential functions. The four (4) dimensions of urban resilience namely infrastructure, social, economic and institutional resilience are considered. Harare was purposefully selected as it is one of the pilot local authorities under the “Partnership for Building Urban Resilience in Zimbabwe” programme by the UNDP, UNICEF and Ministry of Local Government, whose goal is to improve urban resilience and strengthen the provision of basic social services and Local Economic Development (LED) targeting unemployed youths, women, and vulnerable groups in urban and peri-urban areas (UNDP Urban Resilience Building Programme Document, 2019). The chapter concludes that there are major gaps in urban resilience building in Harare. The City is characterised by under-investment in critical infrastructure, weak urban planning and governance frameworks (including outdated policy frameworks) and lack of climate adaption planning. These factors not only work against urban resilience building, but they also hinder progress towards achieving resilient, inclusive and sustainable urban communities. For effective urban resilience building, Harare needs to prioritise investment in resilient urban infrastructure (water, sanitation, and storm water), research on the vulnerability of cities and towns, internalising global and national frameworks on climate change through climate adaption planning and strengthening urban planning and governance.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112518545"

For achieving these goals, various models have been experimented amongst which Circular Economy (CE) is one of the economic models facilitating key policy objectives for generating economic growth and reducing environmental impacts. In economies, cities are focal points of strengthening the transition of linear to a circular economy by smart practices towards a regenerative system. By consuming the assets at their highest utility, there will be an increase in economic resilience of the city and its citizens. The Smart Cities (SCs) and Smart Cities Mission (SCM) of India, Make in India, Digital India, and the Swachh Bharat Mission has potential to integrate CE principles in a pronounced way to pave the way towards a circular transition. To fulfill the SCs objectives, Indian cities have been integrating smart practices (like waste management, e-governance, and smart mobility) with circularity. For the challenges faced by the cities from the design until the implementation phase, circular economy calls for a refit in resource management. These would require policy-level reforms, institutional capacity building, uplifting infrastructure, and financing mechanisms. In India, there is already an existing repair and refurbish culture with strong local traditions integrating the 6Rs. The paper reviews the role of CE in Indian SCM for achieving SDGs by finding opportunities for circular economy and providing recommendations based on them. A matrix has been developed between the ReSOLVE framework and the opportunities of CE in cities. The SCM has increased the pace of transition, yet the recommendations are given to implement the CE principles efficiently.","Circular Economy; Smart Cities; Sustainable Development; E-government; Economics; Environmental Impact; Environmental Protection; Planning; Smart City; Waste Management; Circular Transitions; Financing Mechanisms; Institutional Capacities; Production Patterns; Regenerative System; Resource Management; Sustainable Cities; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106203541"

(https://www.un.org ) Smart sustainable cities technologies and approaches, including those based on information and communications technology (ICT) solutions and Internet of things (IoT), are already helping people to overcome multiple challenges of urban development and to progress towards achieving global objectives for cities, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 11 ‘Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’ (The first United Smart Cities SMART CITY LAB opened in Vienna, supporting co-creation of solutions for smart sustainable cities worldwide 2018, [1]). The Smart Cities Mission (SCM), launched in 2015, by the Government of India, aims at building up sustainable and inclusive cities that provide core infrastructure, a clean and sustainable environment and a decent quality of life to its citizens. The strategic components of the Mission are city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (greenfield development) with smart solutions applied in service delivery and governance (SDG India Index & Dashboard 2019–2020, [2]). There are several urbanization models that incorporate digital technologies to address some of the urbanization and sustainability challenges: Digital cities feature the integration of digital technology into the city’s core infrastructure systems; intelligent cities rely on the digital city infrastructure to build intelligent buildings, transportation systems, schools, enterprises, public spaces, public services, etc., and to integrate them into intelligent urban systems; and smart cities—deploy intelligent urban systems at the service of socio-economic development and improving urban quality of life (Estevez et al, Smart sustainable cities, reconnaissance study 2016, [3]) So, here, we are trying to deal with systems of systems in physical ecosystems powered by various ICT and digital technologies. Meanwhile, the existing technological approaches tend to latch onto the most hyped technology of the year and produce many silo-ed solutions for smart cities which, although elevates technology innovation, fails to engage its citizens. Therefore, a design intervention is needed to help bridge this and make technologies work for humans, the citizens and the primary stakeholder. This interpretation paper is an inquisition into the role of design and designers, to bring the right kind of approach when it comes to sustainable smart city design. The paper first lays down the high-level role and responsibilities of designers and its various other key stakeholders in crafting a smart city. Then, it talks about the right kind of methodologies that designers bring at all levels of sustainable smart city design—from working with official bodies in co-creation and collaboration mode to the end-users—the citizens—to understand their wants, needs and desires. The paper then details out a case study of a smart campus where the aforementioned methods are applied in order to come up with the most effective designs for the smart city that meet the official bodies’ KPI requirements and at the same time, delivers best-in-class experiences to citizens.","Design For Smart Cities; Experience Design; Experience Design For Sustainable Smart Cities; Iot; Sustainability Development Goals; Sustainable Smart City; Bridges; Economics; Http; Intelligent Buildings; Internet Of Things; Network Security; Smart City; Structural Design; Sustainable Development; System Of Systems; Urban Growth; Urban Transportation; Digital Technologies; Information And Communications Technology; Internet Of Things (iot); Socio-economic Development; Sustainable Environment; Technology Innovation; Transportation System; Urban Quality Of Life; Economic And Social Effects","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105945151"

If countries around the world are to meet challenging global carbon reduction targets, then how our cities are governed and managed to maximize energy efficiency is of vital importance. Faith is increasingly being placed in what are commonly referred to as 'smart cities.' Smart cities seemingly offer a utopian vision of urban integration, efficiency and [subsequent] carbon reductions, yet urbanisation presents real challenges, as noted by Sustainable Development Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. Cities are made up of people and increasingly both policymakers and practitioners are starting to see citizens as an essential stakeholder, even if there is a blurring over the boundaries between citizens and consumers. It is unclear what these people actually refer to when they talk about citizen engagement. Adopting key theoretical underpinning of ladder of participation (Arnstein), this research will present findings from case studies of novel citizen engagement from around the world, notably Nottingham (UK), Espoo (Finland) and Portland (USA).

The persona profiles created by using the interview data have potential applications for those working in information organizations, and to help researchers and practitioners in information organizations design better services for urban Latinx communities.

Inspired by the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 11; making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, this study critically analyses the linkages between risk, justice, inclusion, trust and power relations in urban spaces with the aim to strengthen tourism governance in Sub-Saharan African urban settings. Document analysis is adopted to draw evidence and critically analyse the sustainability of tourism in the three Sub-Saharan cities: Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Harare, Zimbabwe. The study reveals that tourism development in Africa is dominantly underpinned by neoliberal development strategies which threaten the sustainability of tourism in African cities. It, therefore, argues for good governance through strong sustainability institutions which strengthen the regulative mechanisms, processes and organizational culture which empowers local communities. Sustainable tourism approaches that are resilient centred have a potential to promote urban tourism in Sub-Saharan African cities.","Africa; Inclusive Tourism; Safe Destination; Sustainable Cities; Urban Risk; Urban Tourism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072291849"

With the rapid development of urbanization in Beijing, the old city is facing the problem that more and more people are working or living in this limited region. How to estimate the land use efficiency in the old city is crucial for the city planners to perform some policy-making decisions. Based on the Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) which is to develop inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements, in which indicator SDG 11.3.1 is designed to testify the land use efficiency that is defined as a ratio between land consumption rate to population growth rate(PGR).This paper focus on how to evaluate the land use efficiency in the old city where the land is limited to a region while people are in a continuous growing. Based on the extraction of buildings from high resolution images with sub-meter spatial resolution in the area enclosed by the second-ring road which is mainly consists of Dongcheng and Xicheng districts, this study obtained the 3D building information including building height and floor numbers over years from 2005, 2010 to 2015 with the help of visually interpretation, POI information and the in situ investigation. By calculating the ratio of the building density growth rate(BDGR) to the population growth rate, the land use efficiency in the old city was computed for each year. Our results showed that most of the ratios are greater than 1 over year from 2005 to 2010 and less than 1 during periods from 2010 to 2015. Which means that the land use efficiency tend to lower from 2010 to 2015 than from 2005&ndash;2010. The reasons caused this phenomenon has been discussed in the discussion part. The results are helpful for local governors or managers to make a better decision in the protection and conservation of the old city, and to keep a sustainable old city.","Building Density Growth Rate; Land Use Efficiency; Old City; Population Growth Rate; Sustainable Development Goal; Efficiency; Growth Rate; Planning; Population Statistics; Building Densities; High Resolution Image; Human Settlements; In-situ Investigations; Land Use Efficiency; Population Growth Rates; Spatial Resolution; Sustainable Cities; Land Use","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083175436"

Urbanization is now recognized as one of the key levers of socio-economic transformation of which urban planning will play a critical role. This global acknowledgement was manifested by the adoption of the New Urban Agenda at the Habitat III conference in Quito in 2016. Urbanization in Africa has presented several challenges such as congestion, urbanization of poverty, rise of informality and complexities in urban management. This chapter analyses and presents the impact and potential of localizing international urban development agenda in African countries. We reviewed various reports and cases from Africa to uncover the renewed urban planning mandate and interest stemming from recently adopted urban development programmes. We paid attention to the contribution of the NUA to address urbanization challenges in Africa. The role of urban planning in the global development agenda and the possible approaches of localizing them in African context is presented using entry points of urban policies, and urban and territorial planning are also assessed with a view to promote sustainable urbanization.","Mdgs; New Urban Agenda; Sdgs; Sustainable Urbanization; Urban Policy","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150736783"

Historically, criminology as a social science emerged as a response to urbanisation and the new opportunities created by cities for criminal activity and victimisation. Thus, Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which ‘aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’, is ripe for criminological input and analysis. SDG 11 tackles housing and basic services, transport systems, urban planning, cultural and natural heritage, disaster prevention, environmental impact, and safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces. There has been ample criminological research on crime and victimisation in various types of human settlements, on transport systems, on the looting and trafficking of cultural heritage, on crimes associated with natural disasters and on the importance of public leisure areas for crime prevention. Yet many of the above goals, as well as the recommendations emerging from these bodies of research, conflict with each other, and must be problematised in their aim to be inclusive of all. Women and children, the elderly and persons with disabilities are usually the reference groups for inclusion, but globally, there are many other groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous communities, and LGBTQI individuals that are commonly excluded. The chapter will analyse SDG 11 against the evidence base of urban criminology as well as the challenges for inclusion, given diversity both within-country as well as globally.","Cities; Housing; Inclusivity; Transport; Victimisation; Women","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148383115"

Despite progress being made, around one billion people currently live in informal settlements, commonly referred to as slums, which are characterised by overcrowded spaces, substandard dwellings where the occupant does not have legal rights to claim, and a lack of basic services such as sanitation and safe drinking water. It is therefore paramount to develop meaningful knowledge to overcome the real-world challenges of housing and human settlement issues faced by communities across the world, in order to contribute to building a more prosperous society, making a positive impact and committing to the common good. This research assesses the living conditions of slum dwellers in an attempt to suggest ways of overcoming housing concerns in urban areas of the Dominican Republic that are particularly vulnerable to natural and manmade hazards. The results from 167 questionnaire responses distributed amongst four slum community zones and one ""improved""housing development zone shows that only seven per cent of slum dwellers have direct access to safe water, which is contrary to past studies and reports. Another important finding was a cause-andeffect- relationship between life satisfaction and electricity provision amongst slum dwellers. Furthermore, the findings indicate that current approaches aimed at tackling housing needs are not sufficient to overcome the overall problem, however, they do generate some improvement when compared to previous endeavours in the past twenty years. Finally, it is recommended that slum resettlement as a strategy should be avoided in favour of upgrading programmes.","Housing; Poverty; Resilience; Sustainable Development; Urban Sprawl; Potable Water; Project Management; Housing Development; Housing Needs; Human Settlements; Informal Settlements; Legal Rights; Living Conditions; Safe Drinking Water; Urban Areas; Housing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096993591"

Specifically, goal eleven associates provision of safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces for vulnerable groups with making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. However, the paucity of baseline data has been identified as a hindrance to implementing this target by many developing nations. Since perception is a salient factor in the use of public space, this article argues that an accurate picture of how public spaces are been used will emerge from an analysis of the perception of public space over time. Therefore, the study aims to assess the changing perceptions of public parks in Makurdi from 1976 to 2018, thereby addressing the gap in baseline data as well as providing a clear picture of public space use over time for forecasting and remedial action. Specific objectives include: identification of park features, analysis of conditions of such features, as well as a perceptual audit of respondents. A sample size of 400 respondents was determined using the Taro Yamane formula applied to the 1991 population census figure. This population was disaggregated according to two age cohorts-<60 years (85%) and > 60 years (15%)-to determine variation over time. The instrument of perception audits was used to collect information on eighteen variables measuring the perception of insecurity and quality using proxies in parks. Findings indicate the respondents' perception of insecurity and poor quality of park premises has been sustained over time in most of the indices measuring perception. Negative views on security and quality of parks are bound to negatively affect the use of parks, especially by vulnerable groups. This study, therefore, recommends the revitalization of parks by emphasising elements that will improve the perception of insecurity and quality in parks especially by vulnerable groups.","Design; Insecurity; Perception; Public Parks; Quality; Utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091442622"

Previously, the need for such a platform was put in relation to the rational use of the underground and the implications onto the management of public land: consequently, even on the mobility infrastructures and transportation systems, as well as risks for people and manufactured goods, but also to prevent potential economic damages from accidental breakage of pipes and ducts. The increased awareness in terms of safety and civil protection has further expanded its importance, linking, for example, its availability to environmental issues (such as hydrogeological instability) to the context of critical infrastructure management (see Directive 2008/114 / EC) Last but not least, the availability of such a register is necessary to publicly check choices on sustainable development, according with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, signed in September 2015 by the Governments of 193 UN Member Countries, specifically with respect to the themes of Strategic Development Goals 9 (“Build Resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”) and 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”). The paper aims at providing solid answers to a multiplicity of operators / stakeholders in this respect / application framework, thanks to the availability of a national information system specifically dedicated to the over- and under-ground network infrastructures - the SINFI1.","Environmental Protection; Information Systems; Information Use; Planning; Public Risks; Sustainable Development; Coordination And Management; Federated Information Systems; Infrastructure Managements; Mobility Infrastructure; National Infrastructure; Strategic Development; Technological Infrastructure; Technological Networks; Information Management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081739643"

To achieve sustainable cities, urban planning of natural spaces must contribute to deal with the socioenvironmental challenges brought by urbanization. However, planning strategies for green infrastructure are frequently skewed toward ecological aspects. Such a unidimensional perspective in the development of planning tools may have a poor contribution to social welfare. Therefore, there is a need for integrating the social aspects to achieve effective planning, and to recognize the social contributions of green infrastructure. The objective of this study is to diagnose the functions and dysfunctions of green infrastructure, as well as its contributions to the social welfare in the Metropolitan Zone of Leon, Mexico. The area of study is characterized by an accelerated urban growth in one of the most dynamic industrial regions in the country. The methodology includes an assessment of green infrastructure components of its distribution. An evaluation of welfare-related social context was also conducted. Main results showed that (i) green infrastructure can be a strategic approach for the land sustainability, (ii) the metropolitan area of Leon showed the existence of key green infrastructure components and reveled a fragmented network of natural spaces and (iii) people perceived social and environmental functions and dysfunctions from green infrastructure components. This study has concluded that an effective planning approach to green infrastructure should integrate functions and dysfunctions related to social context. This approach may contribute to create more sustainable cities with benefits for all people.","Green Infrastructure; Planning; Quality Of Life; Social Welfare; Urban Sustainability","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073224368"

Among the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, is specifically dedicated to urban systems and its ambitious goal is “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. The “urban green spaces” is a heritage of the complex city, which requires careful assessment that considers not only the economic variable, but also the social, environmental and institutional ones. The “urban green spaces” destined to agricultural activities, defined “urban gardens”, are able to offer answers to renewed food, environmental and socio-cultural needs. They can therefore be an important instrument for the integration between building renovation and natural and agricultural environments and could contribute to reducing the vulnerability of the urban system. Despite growing attention to “urban gardens” in the scientific literature, their inclusion in urban planning is not yet seen as a strategic element for a sustainable, resilient and inclusive social city model. The research aims to define the value of urban agriculture as an important instrument to regenerate abandoned or degraded urban areas, with a prevalent social and inclusive function. The proposed research is developed in the neighborhood of the city of Catania (Italy), called “Librino”. The research analyzes the relations among the beneficiaries of the “urban gardens” of Librino with the aim of assessing the social and inclusive function of the urban agricultural cor of the municipal initiative, applying the Social Network Analysis (SNA) methodology.","Agro-urban-planning; Green Infrastructures; Resilient Cities; Social Network Analysis (sna); Urban Agriculture; Urban Ecosystem; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Metropolitan Area Networks; Social Networking (online); Sustainable Development; Agricultural Activities; Agricultural Environments; Green Infrastructure; Natural Environments; Resilient Cities; Scientific Literature; Urban Agricultures; Urban Ecosystem; Urban Planning","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070538998"

Based on their sustained economic growth, Asian-Pacific cities have played a transformative role in the region, and are on the forefront of economic, social, political, and informational and technological change. However, they are also characterized by widespread urban poverty and inequality, enormous deficiencies in access to shelter and services, and deteriorating quality of the urban environment. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) aims to address the main issues faced by cities and human settlements around the world today, and outlines key principles and commitments towards addressing them. First, this chapter contextualises the NUA vis-à-vis the key sustainable and inclusive urban development issues worldwide. Second, it systematically reviews the idea of governance, and its evolution and theoretical underpinnings since the early 1980s in relation to the changing emphases of overseas development aid. Likewise, it provides insights into the ideas and literature related to governance, decentralization and democratization, and their relevance to cities. Third, the chapter juxtaposes the NUA with the urban realities of the Asia-Pacific region, and reviews three areas of immediate concern: (i) urban governance as an umbrella to respond to urban challenges, (ii) urban planning and policy, and (iii) service delivery and access for social inclusion. In doing so, it highlights the latest tenets of the global urban agenda that are articulated in the NUA, and Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Finally, by providing a brief introduction to the various chapters, it explains how they are organized in the following three sections of the book: (i) urban planning and policy, (ii) innovations in service delivery and access for social inclusion, and (iii) emerging trends and future trajectories.","Access To Basic Services; Asia-pacific; Inclusive Cities; New Urban Agenda; Service Delivery; Sustainable Cities; Urban Governance; Urban Planning And Policy","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065846275"

As a common concern of ‘New-type Urbanization’ and ‘Rural vitalization strategy’, China is undergoing economic transformation, protecting urban green space (UGS), and promoting ecological utilization of land. However, the spatial pattern and driving mechanism of UGS remain unclear. Thus, this paper attempts to introduce production factors, and creates a new analysis framework for primary production factors (PPFs) and expanded production factors (EPFs). Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) are also used to reveal the driving mechanism. The study found the following: (1) From 2006–2015, UGS formed a ‘T’ pattern in China, with the Yangtze River as the horizontal axis and the eastern coastal region as the vertical axis. (2) The main driving force is PPFs comprising labour, land, and capital. However, the role of EPFs represented by technology and management remains inadequate. (3) The driving force of production factors on UGS has spatial heterogeneity. Labour has increased UGS in the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration. Technology and management factors have developed UGS in the northeast district. In the western district, capital has gradually become an important reason for the development of UGS. Additionally, the land factor has significantly affected UGS in south-western China. Based on the results, a viable future management strategy for UGS is to increase the effective input and liquidity of production factors. Finally, the novel perspective using multidimensional production factors can provide useful inspiration for future research.","China; Driving Mechanism; Production Factors; Spatial Pattern; Urban Green Space; Future Prospect; Greenspace; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Urban Area; Urban Planning; Urban Policy; Urbanization; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072706453"

The understanding of the process of urbanisation and the capacity to monitor the SDGs require a wealth of open, reliable, locally yet globally comparable data, and a fully-fledged data revolution. In this framework, the European Commission-Joint Research Centre has developed a suite of (open and free) data and tools named Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) which maps the human presence on Earth (built-up areas, population distribution and settlement typologies) between 1975 and 2015. The GHSL supplies information on the progressive expansion of built-up areas on Earth and population dynamics in human settlements, with both sources of information serving as baseline data to quantify land use efficiency (LUE), listed as a Tier II indicator for SDG 11 (11.3.1). In this paper, we present the profile of the LUE across several territorial scales between 1990 and 2015, highlighting diverse development trajectories and the land take efficiency of different human settlements. Our results show that (i) the GHSL framework allows us to estimate LUE for the entire planet at several territorial scales, opening the opportunity of lifting the LUE indicator from its Tier II classification; (ii) the current formulation of the LUE is substantially subject to path dependency; and (iii) it requires additional spatially-explicit metrics for its interpretation. We propose the Achieved Population Density in Expansion Areas and the Marginal Land Consumption per New Inhabitant metrics for this purpose. The study is planetary and multi-temporal in coverage, demonstrating the value of well-designed, open and free, fine-scale geospatial information on human settlements in supporting policy and monitoring progress made towards meeting the SDGs.","Achieved Population Density In Expansion Areas; Ghsl; Land Use Efficiency; Land Use Land Cover; Marginal Land Consumption Per New Inhabitant; Population Mapping; Sdg 11; Urban Expansion; Urban Sprawl; Urbanisation; Baseline Survey; Data Interpretation; Global Perspective; Human Settlement; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Population Distribution; Population Dynamics; Urban Sprawl; Urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073947305"

Such an unsustainable system is frequently observed at universities, as these houses a large concentration of people and vehicles, without proper planning. To promote sustainable strategies at universities, this research aims to focus on the sustainable mobility plan (SMP) applied at the University of Passo Fundo (UPF). Design/methodology/approach: Bibliographic research about the current mobility of the campus has been carried out. A questionnaire was distributed to understand opinions about the subject of key people. Findings: The priority treatment given to vehicles, mostly, is an alert factor, which must be solved immediately, considering the need of planning and restructuring it. The suggestions of possible solutions were also relevant, and are being considered for the plan’s implementation. Originality/value: This study stands out for using the 2030 Agenda, specifically Goal 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable), using the university campus as a study object. The mobility plan elaboration was constituted by several actions to fill all parts of the mentioned goal. This study stands out because its methodology can be used in other universities besides UPF and also, to a larger scale, in cities, with similar technical features.","Mobility Plan; Sustainable Cities And Communities (sdg 11); Sustainable Development; Sustainable Mobility Plan; University Campus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065652602"

The adoption of an on-the-edge artificial intelligence architecture brings a set of advantages: safety, reliability, promptness and low power consumption. The embedded intelligence is trained from a purpose-built dataset enclosing environmental car engine sound data. A pre trained ANN classifies sound events and counts cars approaching and leaving the microphone by sensing the Doppler Effects in the sound emitted by the moving vehicles.

Meanwhile, in cities, the intensity and frequency of heat waves and heavy precipitation events have further increased as the urban climate has additionally been affected by rapid land surface change, enhanced anthropogenic heat release, and massive aerosol emissions. These enhanced aerosol emissions also deteriorate the air quality, often causing severe air quality problems in cities. The added urbanization effect on global and regional climate change has imposed increasingly serious impacts on the dense population, heavy traffic, vast infrastructure, and economic assets of urban areas. China has experienced much faster warming than the global average from the late of 20st century, especially since 1990. The average warming rate in the seven largest cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Chongqing) is higher than the average for China as a whole during the most recent 60 years. The number of hot days with maximum surface air temperatures over 35°C has increased markedly since 1990. In the past two decades, many cities, such as Beijing, Jinan, and Chongqing have experienced extremely heavy precipitation events, causing dozens of fatalities. During the past 50 years, severe air pollution conditions have frequently occurred in many cities over eastern China. In South China, the Huanghe-Huaihe River Basin and North China, increasing trends in the number of haze days are evident. Influenced by global warming, cities in low-lying coastal areas are highly susceptible to sea level rise and the related impacts of sea water encroachment, especially during tropical cyclone and storm surge periods. In cities in northern China and inland areas, climate change-related drought frequently significantly impacts water resources and ecosystem services. In recent years, the issue of urban climate change has received considerable attention in China. Many climate change adaptation strategies have been put into action in cities. Also, urban areas account for about 75% of energy-related CO<inf>2</inf> emissions worldwide, and thus play a dominant role in the mitigation of global greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, increased urban climate change and its impacts greatly challenge the social, economic and ecological sustainable development of China's cities. In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, at the heart of which are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Goal 11, on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, directly targets dealing with the challenges brought by urbanization. Many other goals, such as Goal 13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, Goal 3 on ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing, Goal 6 on ensuring access to water and sanitation, and Goal 15 on protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, are all related to tackling climate change issues from the perspectives of human security and health, more resilient economies, and ecosystems. Obviously, implementation of these United Nations SDGs brings immediate impetus and new opportunities for climate change responses in cities. In the future, the impacts of global climate change and urbanization are expected to further increase. Cities will face more serious and complicated climate change risks to human health, economic development, and ecosystem services as our expectation of more hazards, higher exposure and vulnerability unfolds. For China, climate change and sustainable development in cities is an extremely prominent issue. However, systematic studies on climate change in cities are very limited, especially in terms of the interactions and mechanisms between global/regional climate change and urbanization processes, high-resolution climate change projections under the consideration of future urban development pathways, impact and risk assessments of climate change in combination with high exposure and vulnerability, and a portfolio of response options and measures for climate change in cities. Effective climate change actions rely on understanding the complexity and uncertainties of future climate change and related risks in cities. Under the framework of sustainable development, following related national green development strategies and polices, taking advantages of science, technology, finance and governance in cities, to actively tackle urban climate change issues, such as enhanced adaptation and mitigation measures, properly selecting development pathways will greatly enhance climate resilience in cities. A series of national actions, such as implementing ""low carbon cities"" and ""sponge cities"", and the ""Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution"", will have co-benefits for climate change responses and sustainable development in cities.","Climate Change; Extreme Events; Sustainable Development; Urbanization; Aerosols; Air Quality; Climate Change; Economics; Ecosystems; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Health Hazards; Health Risks; Pollution Control; Risk Assessment; River Pollution; Sea Level; Seawater; Storms; Sustainable Development; Urban Growth; Water Resources; Anthropogenic Heat Release; Climate Change Adaptation; Climate Change Projections; Extreme Events; Prevention And Controls; Regional Climate Changes; Surface Air Temperatures; Urbanization; Planning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071234246"

This paper mainly focused on the 11th SDG, which is a universal call to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The full permutation polygon synthetic indicator (FPPSI) method was applied to synthetically evaluate the sustainable level of 26 cities in the YRD urban agglomeration from 2007 to 2016. The results showed that: (1) the synthesis indicators were increasing year by year, which implied that the sustainable development of the YRD has shown obvious progress in recent years. However, each city faced its own challenges to achieving the sustainable development goals. The sustainability level for the majority of cities was restricted by obstacles such as the per capita green area, air quality and commercial housing sales area; (2) Among the 26 cities, small and medium-sized cities were subject to the traditional strong sustainability indicators while large and mega cities were more affected by weak sustainability indicators; (3) Spatial differences were found for the overall sustainable development level of the YRD. The diffusion and assembly effect among cities had not yet been formed; however, the strong spillover effect of developed cities might influence the ability of other cities to achieve sustainable development goals in many aspects of the environment, economy and society. The results suggest the need for a stronger focus on improving regional developing patterns and strengthening coordination in the process of achieving the sustainable development goal of urban agglomeration in the YRD. Furthermore, according to the conditions of different cities, integrated policies are required to address all aspects of sustainability and to avoid unintended consequences.","Full Permutation Polygon Synthetic Indicator (fppsi) Method; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Sustainability Assessment; Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration; Agglomeration; Implementation Process; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; United Nations; Urban Economy; Urbanization; Air Quality; Article; City; Coordination; Diffusion; Housing; Human; River; Synthesis; China; Environmental Protection; Motivation; Yangtze Delta; Cities; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Goals; Humans; Rivers; Sustainable Development; Urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069269125"

In this paper, the authors question if experimental applications based on gamification can co-produce more sustainable neighborhoods through an impact evaluation method that departs from individual choices within the complex of urban mobility. This investigation is carried out within MUV (Mobility Urban Values), an EU research and innovation project, which aims to trigger more sustainable urban mobility in six pilot cities. This article describes the critical method of validation, an impact assessment of the MUV experimental gamification in the pilot cities, in order to represent a proof for future urban strategies. This methodological approach is based on an evaluation structured on indicators of both impact and process suitable for urban contexts. As based on six pilot cities, with possibilities for transferability to other contexts and scalability to other cities, the method represents a reference work for the evaluation of similar experimental applications.","Agenda 2030; Behavioral Change; Impact Assessment; Impact Evaluation; Impact Indicators; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Mobility; Urban Mobility","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072660083"

Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, the overall process of China's construction of sustainable cities and development can be divided into three stages: The initial practice stage (1986-2000), the stage focusing on transformation (2001-2012), and the stage emphasizing coordinated development and social fairness (2012 to present). During the process, China has proposed and carried out a series of pilot demonstrations of sustainable cities, eco-cities, garden cities, low-carbon cities, livable cities, resilient cities, sanitary cities, sponge cities, and circular economy cities. It has achieved remarkable results with valuable experience; meanwhile, it still faces many challenges considering the current practices. With the integration of planning for the national economy and social development, rural and urban development, land use, and other aspects, as well as the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, sustainable urban practices in China will receive more policy support and effective administrative support.

Due to the prominent role of urbanization, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #11 was introduced to make cities and human settlements more resilient, sustainable, safe and inclusive. The frameworks built so far to assess sustainable urban development primarily focus on sustainability, disregarding inclusiveness, safety and resilience. Under the joint consideration of these four facets, this research devised a new tool to evaluate communities and cities by selecting 61 indicators from an extensive literature review, which were weighted subsequently to ensure the balance among the four sustainability dimensions, namely society, economy, environment and governance. Data extracted from international organizations and the targets of the SDGs were used to score the indicators of the system. Mexico City, as one of the most overcrowded cities in the planet, was selected as a case study to apply the proposed tool. The research determined that the minimum thresholds set for the safety, sustainability and inclusiveness domains were not reached. In contrast, the city performed over the resilience limit. Consequently, RESSICOM was revealed as a helpful framework to identify shortcomings in cities related to the achievement of SDG #11.","Inclusiveness; Resilience; Safety; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Urbanization; Accident Prevention; Planning; Urban Growth; Development And Applications; Inclusiveness; International Organizations; Literature Reviews; Resilience; Sustainability Dimensions; Sustainable Urban Development; Urbanization; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055964125"

In the recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the theme of sustainable cities and communities is stand-alone goal 11, also known as the ‘Urban SDG’. It identifies the potential of cities to enable social, economic and environmental advancements to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. On the other hand, the concept of the circular economy and its restorative and regenerative nature by design presents practical and innovative opportunities for cities to retain the value of existing resources. At this point in time, there are extensive opportunities associated with the recovery of materials and resources across the value chain in a city. For instance, producers can retain the value of materials and the value chain by using recycled materials or using a leasing model rather than ownership. This will greatly reduce carbon footprints in the existing demand points in cities as well as in production, distribution, transportation and manufacturing. Consequently, the potential of cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the auspices of the 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change through circular economy business models and initiatives, is slowly featuring in academic discussions. Hence, this chapter identifies the nexus between circular economy and climate change mitigation for small and medium-sized cities (SMCs) in the context of sustainable supply chains. This chapter assesses SMCs in the Netherlands with a population range of between 50,000 and 250,000 namely Almere, Dordrecht, Zwolle, Haarlemmermeer and Venlo. Turin and The Hague (classified as large cities) are analysed as control cases to explain some findings that suggest the size of the city as the factor for disparities and/or similarities among cities. The ultimate goal of this chapter is to contribute to the global discussions on Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change by identifying opportunities for sustainable supply chains in the transition to circular cities.","Circular Cities; Circular Economy; Collaborations; Sustainable Supply Chain","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121678777"

Particularly, the work aims in defining a methodology suitable to measure the spillover effect of urban regeneration on urban spaces and city users. According to the 11th Sustainable Development Goal, given by United Nations with the Agenda 2030 for the Sustainable Development, who asks cities and human settlements to become safe, inclusive resilient and sustainable, the methodology aims to give a tool that can help in monitoring if changes of the structural shape of cities are going into the direction drew by the Agenda. The developed methodology is subdivided into three steps: quantification, assessment and monitoring. The first one starts with the deliberations analysis from which it was possible to define the process behind every urban transformation. In the second step each transformation has been mapped, with a linked database, containing the data recorded, such as the intervention type, the cost or the year in which the building site started. The third phase is the monitoring and it let to assess the effects of these transformations in time. The case study of the work is the process of diffuse urban regeneration that occurred in Brescia between 2013 and 2018. In this period plenty of urban operations have been done. Some of these operations are still happening now and they are deeply changing districts shape. Attention was given to the analysis of pedestrian and cycle paths. Particularly, it is important to observe how they contribute in creating a network of clean mobility inside and between districts promoting and enhancing a sustainable and inclusive lifestyle, as it is suggested by the United Nations.","Metadata; Planning; Urban Planning; Assessment And Monitoring; Building Sites; Human Settlements; Spillover Effects; Structural Shape; Transformation Effects; United Nations; Urban Cities; Urban Regeneration; Urban Spaces; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117600111"

The approach is part of a more general framework of research focusing on ""transport/land use"" relationships, with its specific connotation based on quantitative indicators and measures. It is applied in particular to a port area affected close to large industrial settlement which has never come into operation and is characterised by evident damage. Measures aimed at the regeneration of the territory, the reorganisation of the facilities system, and the enhancement of the port infrastructure in an eco-sustainable perspective are outlined. The accessibility analyses underline in quantitative terms, through appropriate models, one of the key elements useful for measuring the impact of the seafront regeneration action.","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097133197"

Against this backdrop, this article sheds light on different pathways through which science can contribute to urban sustainability. In particular, we discern four forms of science-policy-society interactions as key vectors: 1. sharing knowledge and providing scientific input to urban sustainability policy-making; 2. implementing transformative research projects; 3. contributing to local capacity building; and 4. self-governing towards sustainability. The pathways of influence are illustrated with empirical examples, and their interlinkages and limitations are discussed. We contend that there are numerous opportunities for actors from the field of sustainability science to engage with political and societal actors to enhance sustainable development at the local level.","Cities; Science-policy Interactions; Sdg 11; Sustainable Development; Urban Sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069162898"

Traditionally, in the classification of cities in India—such as “class I-VI cities,” “metro city,” “mega city,” etc., population size was one of the major criteria; the city size was used to signify the level and number of functions it performs. Most of the world’s population today lives in cities and over time, due to the size of the population, various problems have emerged. Increasing urban population with urban-ward migration is responsible for many challenges faced by the cities around the world, especially in Asian, sub-Saharan Africa, and Indian cities. Cities such as Delhi and Mumbai are the worst affected by the large population base, in which the rapidly increasing population has severely affected capacity of cities. Due to resource constraints, it will be difficult in the future to provide all services to residents. In addition, unplanned growth will lead to many types of social, economic, environment, and health problems.","Inclusive; Mega-city; Metropolitan; Resilience; Smart City; Sustainable; World-class Cities","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062450010"

Therefore, countries of the Global North such as Germany have signed the commitment to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the SDGs need to be “translated” to the specific national context. Existing sustainability indicators and monitoring and reporting systems need to be adjusted as well. Our paper evaluates how three different initiatives translated SDG 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable”) to the German context, given the specific role of cities in contributing to sustainable development. These initiatives included the official ‘National Sustainable Development Strategy’ of the German Government, a scientific initiative led by the ‘German Institute for Urban Affairs’, and a project carried out by the ‘Open Knowledge Foundation’, a non-governmental organization (NGO). This article aims to analyze how global goals addressing urban developments are contextualized on a national level. Our findings demonstrate that only a few of the original targets and indicators for SDG 11 are used in the German context; thus, major adjustments have been made according to the main sustainability challenges identified for Germany. Furthermore, our results show that the current contextualization of SDG 11 and sustainable urban development in Germany are still ongoing, and more changes and commitments need to be made.","Agenda 2030; Cities; Indicators; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban Development; Urban Sustainability Transformations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061433255"

According with the UN Sustainable Development Goal approach, our cities and human settlements have to become ""more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable"". In other words our cities have to become ""greener"", considering the help in that sense that can derive by a widespread application of urban green technologies. These technologies, as green roofs or green walls, can represent a very important tool in terms of thermal insulation, heat island effect reduction and in general energy saving at building and district scale. In recent years the mechanisms that govern exchanges between green walls (roofs and façades) and outdoor environmental air in terms of heat and mass transfer have been studied more and more in the literature. The approaches mostly used for these studies are experimental local measurements in order to characterize heat and mass transfer between the building and the environment, while theoretical studies, especially numerical studies, are still lacking. In this work, after a general overview related with environmental benefit deriving from Green Technologies at urban level, a short study results are proposed related with heat and mass transfer between green façades and green roofs and the local environment around buildings. As a case study, the transpiration cooling of vegetation as a measure to mitigate outdoor air temperatures is investigated in the case of an experimental green roof that is present over a building, in the laboratories area, inside the Campus of the Bologna University Engineering School.","Micro-climate; Nature Based Solutions; Sustainability; Urban Resilience","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056828288"

Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide a means for cities to successfully navigate the water-energy-climate relationship, thus enhancing urban resilience. Implementation of NBS can improve local or regional economic resilience underpinned by the sustainable use of natural resources. The innovative governance, institutional, business, and finance models and frameworks inherent to NBS implementation also provide a wealth of opportunity for social transformation and increased social inclusiveness in cities. The ultimate benefit of NBS implementation in cities is increased livability, which is typically measured as a function of multiple social, economic and environmental variables. Given the range of different interventions classified as NBS and the cross-sectoral character of their co-benefits, different assessment schemes can be used to evaluate NBS performance and impact. Herein, performance and impact indicators within three robust NBS- and Smart City-related assessment schemes-Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES), Knowledge and Learning Mechanism on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (EKLIPSE), and Smart City Performance Measurement Framework (CITYkeys)-were critically analyzed with respect to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, ""Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable."" Each selected assessment scheme was benchmarked with respect to the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators' global indicator framework for the sub-objectives of SDG 11. The alignment between each of the selected NBS assessment schemes and the SDG indicator framework was mapped with particular emphasis on consistency with city-level framework indicators for each SDG 11 sub-objective. The results were illustrated as composite scores describing the alignment of the analyzed NBS and Smart city assessment schemes with the SDG 11 sub-objectives. These results facilitate NBS assessment scheme selection based on alignment between each analyzed assessment scheme and specific SDG 11 sub-objectives. Cities face multiple challenges amidst a complex hierarchy of legislative, regulatory and other stakeholder obligations. The present study showed that strategic selection of an NBS assessment scheme which closely aligns with one or more sub-objectives within SDG 11 can maximize operational efficiency by exploiting synergies between evaluation schemes.","Climate Change Adaptation; Green Infrastructure; Impact Indicator; Nature-based Solution; Performance Indicator; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Urbanization; Urban Resilience","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050411497"

Some measures can be adopted to improve the implementation of SDGs in a more integrative way. The seventeen goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 are integrated and indivisible and should be implemented based on global partnership. Considering that multi-stakeholder partnership can be a critical factor in achieving the goals, understanding the potential of collaboration between distinct stakeholders is an essential starting point for successful SDG implementation. In Brazil, a national strategy to implement the SDGs has already been launched and involves many challenges that need to be overcome. In this research, to get better knowledge of the ongoing implementation of SDG 11, “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,” a qualitative analysis was carried out to identify the major vulnerabilities and common interests for an integrated implementation of SDG 11 in Brazil. Data was collected through stakeholder interviews and document review. A total of thirty-three highly representative stakeholders were sampled purposively from six stakeholder’s categories: 1) National Government, 2) Business and Industry, 3) Non-Governmental Organizations, 4) Scientific and Technological Institutions, 5) Youth, and 6) UNDP Representative. Findings suggest that there are more trade-offs than synergies concerning the implementation of SDG 11 in Brazil. Also, governance structure, funding allocation, and social participation are key themes to be addressed by the Brazilian government to achieve better coordination and enhance the integrated implementation of SDG 11 in Brazil.","2030 Agenda; Multi-stakeholder Approach; Nvivo","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065064961"

The built environment plays a key role on the triple bottom line of the sustainable development - Planet, People, Profit - because of several environmental, social and economic impacts produced by the construction sector. The acknowledged need to promote a sustainable building market is an international high-priority issue as underlined by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Indeed one of its strategic objectives highlights to make cities and human settlement inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. In line with the 2020 Europe Strategy and the European 2050 Roadmap, energy efficiency and CO<inf>2</inf> savings towards a low-carbon economy are regarded as ambitious objectives to be achieved for both new and existing buildings. Thus, controlling and reducing the environmental impacts of new constructions is fundamental. In line with this, the “Energy efficient LIghtweight Sustainable SAfe steel construction” (ELISSA) research project financed under the European FP7 aimed to develop a modular Cold - formed steel system that is energy efficient and robust. This paper presents the life cycle analysis of the building developed as case demonstrator. It analyses the environmental impacts during both the construction and the deconstruction phase. This works provides a benchmark of the current possibilities offered by lightweight steel structures in the framework of sustainable constructions.","Construction Industry; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Impact; Global Warming; Intelligent Buildings; Life Cycle; Planning; Population Statistics; Renewable Energy Resources; Steel Research; Steel Structures; Studs (structural Members); Construction Sectors; Life Cycle Analysis; Light-weight Steels; Scientific Community; Social And Economic Impacts; Strategic Objectives; Sustainable Building; Sustainable Construction; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062779508"

Economic development and population growth have brought diverse needs of citizens for urban mobility resulting in various forms of urbanization including suburbanization, urban sprawl, and local or cross-border city clusters, and this has generated greater citizens' demands for quality, resilient, safe and secure infrastructure services. As infrastructures of different cities within a cluster are highly interdependent and interconnected, any minor disruptions of a single infrastructure component within a city could lead to unpredictable knock-on effects on its neighbors. Despite great research efforts being attributed to community and city resilience, there are limited studies focusing on regional infrastructure resilience within the city clusters, in particular those cross-border city clusters like the Pearl River Delta city cluster of China. This paper aims to investigate the necessities and challenges of strengthening regional infrastructure resilience within the city clusters by applying and extending an integrated framework for resilience management of internetwork city infrastructures developed by the authors. The necessities, gaps and challenges will be explored from multiple perspectives not least the organizational structure, people, policy, management process, technology and supporting system, as well as the decision-making and performance management perspectives. Two typical city clusters in China are selected for case studies. Programs and practices of the cities within the two clusters pertinent to sustainable development, climate change, urban planning, built environment management and hazard management are critically examined and analyzed to produce a panoramic view on the necessities and challenges.

This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) “localization” - the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on the “data revolution” and “smart city” also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring.","Development Indicator; Institutional Framework; Sustainable Development; Technological Change; United Nations; Urban Development; Urban Politics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010382773"

In addition to said risks, a number of security solutions, for example in the field of CCTV, are linked with significant privacy risks. Therefore, an appropriate certification scheme for security systems that not only considers security aspects but also additional issues, e.g. data protection and privacy, is needed in Europe.

Despite the importance of infrastructure in the functioning of African cities, there are few attempts at investigating its contribution from a city perspective. This paper investigates how the provision of infrastructure contributes to the prosperity of African cities, using Expert Opinion Survey from a diverse selection of cities. Trends in three components of infrastructure - water supply, road network and telecommunications are examined. Serious water shortage characterizes 79% of the African cities in the study. However, cities such as Gaborone and Algiers located in arid regions of Africa are better able to meet their water supply needs largely due to effective water governance and management. The dysfunctional nature of roads in African cities poses a major challenge to the prosperity of these cities. Compared to other components of infrastructure, telecommunications is ranked as the most developed form infrastructure in African cities. This is attributed to the spectacular growth in the mobile phone industry over the last one and half decades. The mobile phone industry acts a catalyst for growth in African cities. Further analysis of the Expert Opinion Survey shows that if developed and effectively managed, infrastructure can contribute to the prosperity of African cities by: driving economic growth; facilitating urban mobility; ensuring greater access to health and education; enhancing safety and security; guiding urban growth; enhancing environmental quality; improving slums conditions; and reducing intra-urban disparities.","African Cities; Catalyst; Expert Opinion Survey; Infrastructure; Prosperity; Catalysts; Cellular Telephones; Economics; Mobile Phones; Surveys; Sustainable Development; Telephone Sets; Water Supply; African Cities; Environmental Quality; Expert Opinion; Human Settlements; Infrastructure; Mobile-phone Industry; Prosperity; Safety And Securities; Urban Growth","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029847382"
