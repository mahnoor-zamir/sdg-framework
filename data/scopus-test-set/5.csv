The Fifth Sustainable Development Goal is to ""achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,"" and the UNWTO, a UN entity with expertise in the tourism industry, is committed to enhancing the beneficial effects of tourism development on women's lives. India is often perceived as a country with a great disadvantage in terms of equal opportunities for both genders, especially in the tourism industry. According to UNWTO, the terrible impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic offer the tourism industry a unique opportunity to reevaluate its gender balance. The main objectives off the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly the commitments to gender equality and the empowerment of women are essential to the continued success of tourism. Women's potential to make a significant contribution to the tourism business is now underutilised since they are concentrated in lower-status, lower-paying jobs.","Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Tourism; Beneficial Effects; Equal Opportunity; Female Entrepreneurs; Gender Equality; Low-paying Job; Tourism Development; Tourism Industry; Leisure Industry","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010806233"

This underrepresentation has a significant and detrimental impact on the efficacy and development of theory, policy, and practice as the related body of knowledge does not adequately reflect the diversity of the communities that practitioner's serve. This study, therefore, critically evaluates the impact of group identity and self-concept on female student experiences of gender bias within emergency management-related higher education programs which act as gateways to the career field. The findings indicate that gender bias within these programs primarily occurs from male peers with female students feeling pressured to work harder than male students to succeed. Occurrences were, however, less frequent than in other male-dominated fields such as construction, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Barriers remain so efforts to promote educational inclusivity and career field representation are necessary to address United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Five which seeks to ""achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"".","Emergency Management; Gender Bias; Group Identity; Higher Education; Self-concept","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204181441"

Through the theoretical lens of a utilitarian perspective, financial investment decisions are often built on the pillars of trust, security, and assurance, which allow consumers to make decisions rationally and gain empowerment when making these decisions. However, due to the widespread manipulations prevailing in Australian financial markets, the role of rationality and its influence on consumer empowerment remain understudied. Based on this context, this paper uncovers the association between how each stage of rational decision-making (RDM) (i.e., demand identification, information search, and the evaluation of alternatives) influences the consumer power (i.e., consumer resistance and consumer influence) of female Australian consumers when making financial investment decisions. In doing so, this study employs a quantitative approach, whereby the proposed conceptual framework is tested among 357 female Australian consumers to understand their decision-making power in the presence of heightened situations of market manipulation in the financial industry. The results show that information search has a significant positive relationship with consumer influence and consumer resistance when making financial investment decisions. Additionally, the findings suggest that female Australian consumers should not only rely on individual-based sources of power but also have exposure to network-based sources of power to gain empowerment when making financial investment decisions. Lastly, it is suggested that government bodies, financial institutions, and regulatory authorities should not only implement financial literacy programs but also promote gender diversity across organisations to encourage women’s empowerment (i.e., Goal 5 (SDGs)—Achieve Gender Equality and Empower all Women and Girls).","Consumer Empowerment; Consumer Power; Financial Investment Decisions; Rational Decision-making; Rationality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219193240"

""Comfort Stations"" were establishments where ""Comfort Women"" were compelled to participate in sexual relations with the Imperial Japanese Army men. The term ""comfort women"" is a piece of linguistic propaganda intended to conceal the fact that the Japanese Government not only sanctioned but also facilitated human trafficking and sexual exploitation of women who came from impoverished backgrounds. The extent of their exploitation, as was revealed later over the years, justifies the contention that the Japanese Government all but forced women into ""sex slavery"" for the sole purpose of keeping their army going. The victims of the Japanese Comfort System are still without justice, nearly eight decades after the Second World War. The injustice that the victims of this system face is in apparent contravention with Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 5, which mandate promoting activities to ensure healthy lives, promote well-being for all at all ages and achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, respectively.","Comfort Stations; Imperial Japanese Army; Reparations; Sexual Exploitation; Trafficking","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214486501"

Excluding them as exceptions creates an important bias in how culture is approached. Nonetheless, some heritage institutions are eager to transform their sustainability aspirations and commitments into action. In this context, the Re-reading Collections Toolkit was produced to address Sustainable Development Goal 5 (part of UN Agenda 2030) ‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’. This paper presents the rationale behind the development of such a toolkit and its application in the National Museum of Ceramics (Spain).

Gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential for advancing sustainable development, specifically within UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, which aim to integrate conservation and sustainable resource use. This study is motivated by the limited research on women’s empowerment in biosphere reserves, specifically its role in sustainable tourism development (STD) and SDG-5 attainment. The study research hypothesizes that women’s entrepreneurship positively influences empowerment, which in turn affects STD, tourism involvement, and support. Using an online survey, the study collected primary data from women in the Bačko Podunavlje region, part of the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve “Mura-Drava-Danube”. It employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test its hypotheses. The results indicate that women’s entrepreneurship significantly contributes to empowerment, subsequently enhances sustainable tourism outcomes. The findings emphasize the need for community members and policymakers to design and implement strategies that reduce gender inequality and foster sustainable development. This study contributes to the literature on women’s empowerment and sustainable tourism in biosphere reserves and offers actionable insights for promoting gender equality through tourism.","Gender Equality; Sdg 5; Support For Tourism; Sustainable Tourism; Tourism Involvement; Women Empowerment; Women Entrepreneurship","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219018732"

There is a major gap when such an important volume as The Routledge International Handbook of Disability and Global Health (Ned et al 2024) does not dedicate considerable space to the role of religion. If the spirit and mantra of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ that drives the SDGs is to be actualised, it is critical that religion, a significant social force in Africa and globally, be appropriated and deployed to secure the rights and guarantee the dignity of people with disabilities. There shall be no sustainable development when religion continues to subject people with disabilities to stigma and exclusion. Human flourishing shall remain a pipe dream when millions of people with disabilities are forced to navigate multiple disabling systems. For example, Sustainable Development Goal Number 5, ‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’, will remain a forlorn ideal as long as women and girls with disabilities continue to bemoan their exclusion as follows: As women and girls with disabilities, we face discrimination and exclusion on a number of grounds. Disability discrimination due to having a disability. Discrimination on the grounds of being a woman or girl and in many countries discrimination because of living in poverty. These are not the only factors causing discrimination for us as women and girls with disabilities but they are significant contributors. (CBM n.d.: 4) Given the strategic role of religion in Africa, including its potential to contribute to development (see, e.g., Chitando, Gunda and Togarasei 2020; Gobo 2020; Golo and Novieto 2022), it is important to reflect on how religion can be a transformative resource for the inclusion of people with disabilities. This volume reflects on the theme of religion, disability and development in Africa. In this introduction, we focus on developments in African Theology and Religious Studies in relation to religion and disability. In particular, we reflect on Sinenhlanhla S.

Research indicates that companies with greater female representation in leadership outperform their peers on enhanced innovation, improved workplace culture, and stronger overall performance (McKinsey 2024). Despite these advantages, the energy sector lags significantly behind other industries, such as government and healthcare, in gender diversity at the C-suite level. (World Economic Forum 2024). According to the World Economic Forum, while women's presence in senior leadership roles had increased marginally to 2022, but then subsequently declined in the last 2 years to below 2021 levels. Sadly, achieving true gender equality remains over 130 years away. (World Economic Forum 2024). The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 5, aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. However, the UN's 2023 report states: ""There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030. Gender equality has not only failed to move forward but has begun to reverse. Without a heightened commitment from the global community, gender equality will remain an unrealised goal."" (United Nations 2023) While legislative measures, such as the 2022 EU Gender Balance Directive, are prompting companies to bring more women into boardrooms, the 2023 Allbright Report finds many organizations are limiting appointments to the minimum required. This signals a compliance mindset rather than a strategic commitment to fostering inclusive leadership pipelines (Allbright 2024).","Engineers; Petroleum Engineering; Sustainable Development; Energy; Energy Sector; Gender Diversity; Gender Equality; Global Challenges; Global Community; Mckinsey; Performance; United Nations; Workplace Culture; Energy Policy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009215314"

The representation of women in leadership positions serves as a measure of gender equality. Empowering women in leadership facilitates inclusive economic growth and allows organisations to have a diversified talent pool. Women continue to be significantly underrepresented in strategic leadership roles within manufacturing pharmaceutical companies (MPCs) operating in South Africa, despite ongoing efforts to promote gender equity. This study aimed to assess the presence of women in board and executive leadership positions and propose strategies to promote gender-inclusive leadership. A systematic desktop review was conducted to analyse the websites and annual reports of 49 publicly listed MPCs that were selected from the South African Pharmacy Council (SAPC) 2021 register. The data were collected on company characteristics, leadership composition, gender distribution and professional qualifications of leaders within each company. The results revealed that women comprised only 29.48% of board members and 27.36% of executive leaders, with female pharmacists representing just 28.1% of leadership positions. Statistical analysis, including Chi-square tests, confirmed a gender disparity, with men significantly more likely to occupy strategic roles. The findings highlighted barriers such as unconscious bias, exclusion from influential networks, limited mentorship and sponsorship opportunities and challenges related to work-life balance. The study concludes that addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach, including structured sponsorship programs, gender-inclusive leadership policies, targeted talent development initiatives and corporate accountability measures. By implementing these strategies, pharmaceutical companies can create a more equitable leadership environment for women to enhance decision-making, innovation and long-term sustainability of the pharmaceutical industry.","Gender Bias; Mentorship; Pharmaceutical Industry; South Africa; Sponsorship; Strategic Leadership; Women In Leadership","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008296463"

Ubuntu cannot become a lived reality if others are excluded from living a holistic life. Hence, the existence of gender inequality in any society defies the principles enshrined in the Ubuntu philosophy. Through literature review, as well as drawing insights from the African feminist theory, our chapter foregrounds the strengths of Ubuntu, while exploring how it could be sharpened to address contemporary global challenges. The overarching question guiding the discussion in this chapter is: “how can the Ubuntu ethos contribute towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5?” The main target for SDG 5 is to “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” Reflecting on the inherent gender inequalities in Africa, our chapter contends that the main goal of SDG 5 will remain a pipedream if half of the African population (women and girls), is excluded from the development processes. We conclude the chapter by proffering that attaining sustainable development should entail redressing gender inequality and discrimination at household, local, national, regional and global levels. This would epitomize the crux of the Ubuntu maxim, “I am because we are and, since we are, therefore I am.”","African Feminist Theory; Gender Inequality; Sustainable Development Goals; Ubuntu; Ecology; Information Systems; Sustainable Development Goals; African Feminist Theory; Development Process; Ecological Integrity; Gender Equality; Gender Inequality; Global Challenges; Literature Reviews; Social Justice; Ubuntu; Well Being; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008166831"

This evaluation indicates that between 2013 and 2017, the JNSWE was effective in increasing Jordanian women's presence in STEM studies due to addressing gender inequality, the gender pay gap, and training deficiencies in the field. The first hypothesis was accepted (Z = −2.812, P >.005, df = 11), and the JNSWE's implementation from 2013 to 2017 increased the number of Jordanian women in science. The execution of the JNSWE (2013–2017) supported the representation of Jordanian women in telecommunications more than before, and Hypothesis H2 was accepted (Z = −2.892, P >.004, df = 11). Ultimately, Hypothesis H3 was approved (Z = −2.254, P >.024, df = 11), and the JNSWE's implementation from 2013 to 2017 increased the number of Jordanian women pursuing careers in engineering and mathematics. In this sense, this evaluation is innovative and responsive to the rising calls and concerns of feminists to empirically address the low presence of Jordanian women in scientific studies science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, known by the acronym STEM, and seeks to eliminate all forms of gender bias against women in the public spheres, including pay inequality. Included are the study's recommendations for further research.","Gender Equality; Gender Pay Gap; Interrupted Time Series (itss); Public Policy-analysis; Quasi-experimental Design (qed); Stem; The Jordanian National Strategy For Women Empowerment (jnswe)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200044714"

In its thrust to achieve gender equality and empower women and girls, it is ambitious and forward-looking as it provides a roadmap towards socio-economic inclusion. While the intention to achieve gender equality is noble and clearly articulated in several studies undertaken with most countries committed to the goal(s), the execution leaves much to be desired. Though religion remains central to the lives of most people in Africa in general and Lesotho in particular, it is, however, cited as both an enabler and an impediment to the achievement of SDG 5. The present chapter hypothesises that religious beliefs, public opinion, and the attitude of leadership in both religious and political spheres are critical in the full achievement of SDG 5. Lesotho has in recent years become the epicentre of murder in Africa. A sharp spike in murders in Lesotho, particularly of girls and women, has in recent years reached unprecedented proportions casting doubt on the country’s commitment to SDGs 5 & 10. This phenomenon necessitates deep reflection and action from all stakeholders. Using the gender justice framework within the context of Aspiration 6 of the ‘Africa We Want,’ the aim of this chapter, which uses a desk-top approach, is to determine the extent to which political and religious leadership, especially Christian leadership, show commitment to gender equality agenda through examining the efforts or lack thereof made by the government and Christian churches in stemming the tide of homicides in general and femicides, in particular, that have engulfed Lesotho in recent years.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000514856"

With more women getting involved in leadership, resource ownership and employment opportunities, it's inspiring to see progress toward equity and equal opportunities for all genders at workplaces. However, discrimination still exists in various parts of the world where women are treated unfairly due to their gender. When societies become more equal, economies become more resilient (Bank, 2022). In this chapter the authors consider gender diversity and what actions could be taken to ensure that people of different genders are treated fairly and have equal opportunities in the workplace. We explore gender equality through the lens of Sustainable Development Goal 5, Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Against a global backdrop where 86/144 world economies impose at least one legal restriction on women’s employment, and nine impose all three, shutting them out of many high-paying jobs and women cannot work the same night hours as men in 21 economies (Bank, 2022), we explore the impact of unequal practice. We pay particular attention to the workplace in the areas of discrimination, effective participation, and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels and access to resources: economic, land, and natural resource ownership. Although progress to redress the balance is being made, it is slow and estimated to take at least 138 years. The authors propose that commitment and bold action are needed to accelerate progress, including through the promotion of laws, policies, budgets, and institutions that advance gender equality (Nations, U., 2022a) and propose solutions to enhance the rate of progress. In this chapter, we'll explore why gender diversity is a sustainable approach that can help address these issues while creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Promoting women's empowerment is essential for reducing violence against women, decision-making in health and well-being, and proper upbringing of children, thereby reducing maternal and child mortality. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess the level of empowerment among married women residing in selected slum settlements of Kolkata, to estimate the proportion of employed women, to describe the pattern of decision-making among them, and to find the sociodemographic factors (if any) associated with the level of empowerment. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out among 350 married women using face-to-face interviews from October 2022 to September 2023. The study utilized a predesigned, pretested, and structured schedule consisting of questions adapted from the National Family Health Survey-5 women's questionnaire. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25.0. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with low and medium women empowerment. Results: Of the 334 participants surveyed, approximately half exhibited low levels of empowerment (49.7%). The majority of study participants reported that decisions pertaining to their own health care, significant household purchases, visits to family or relatives, and voting in elections were made jointly by both spouses. The age of the respondent between 19 and 28 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.54 [1.09-18.80]) and the age of husband between 35 and 48 years (AOR 4.48 [1.46-8.28]) had statistically significant higher AOR of low women empowerment. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of women in the study had low empowerment scores and less than one-fifth were employed.

Findings: Findings suggest that gender-inclusive HRM practices substantially affect female employees' psychological empowerment and career progression. Psychological empowerment is a mediating mechanism that explains the effect of gender-inclusive HRM practices on female employees' career progression. Finally, overall fairness perception further amplifies the effect of gender-inclusive HRM practices on psychological empowerment and career progression. Practical implications: The study provides evidence to policymakers that organizations may promote psychological empowerment and career progression of female employees by implementing gender-inclusive HRM practices and promoting overall fairness perception. Originality/value: This study contributes to achieving the SDGs by examining the impact of gender-inclusive HRM practices and overall fairness perception on female employees' psychological empowerment and career progression.

It helps to understand the different forms of sexual abuse experienced by teenagers as well as portrays how space plays a major role in the act. This article aims to highlight the role of the material world in the act as well as how the social, political, and cultural contexts are materialized in the act of sexual abuse. Also, this article analyses how the existing intervention mechanisms support the prevention of sexual abuse in different social settings as well as emphasizes the gaps in the intervention mechanisms apropos the chosen narrative data. To sum up, this study aims to create awareness, provides prevention mechanisms considering the role of the material world, and advocates for SDG 16 (Promote justice, peaceful and inclusive societies) and SDG 5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls).","Covid-19; Ipa; Lived Experiences; Pain; Pandemic; Phenomenology; Sexual Abuse; Teenage","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189180602"

Using Ethiopia as a case study, this paper examines how local laws applied in Sharia and Customary Dispute Resolution courts impact gender equality and the health of women and girls inspite of the inculcation of human rights statutes into national legislation, including the Constitution. We identify several key issues with the substantive law and its enforcement. First, laws which have been instituted at the national level to improve gender equally have been poorly enforced at the local level. Second, there is a sustained enforcement of laws that oppress women and that protect male perpetrators of gender-based violations. Third, local courts limit female representation and uphold patriarchy. To improve the health of women and girls, stakeholders must take into consideration the ways in which legal systems uphold harmful gender norms and obstruct and/or advance progress towards equal representation, opportunities, and constitutionally-mandated protections for all.","Child Marriage; Female Genital Cutting; Female Genital Mutilation; Gender Equality; Humad Rights; Article; Child; Court; Epidemiology; Ethiopia; Female; Female Genital Mutilation; Gender; Gender Equity; Human; Human Rights; In-law; Law; Male; Marriage; Offender; Sustainable Development Goal; Cultural Diversity; Cultural Diversity; Female; Human Rights; Humans; Male","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187784578"

We argue that health equity and gender equality are ‘twin forces’ that are historically connected and cannot be separated, creating either strong co-benefits or a ‘double jeopardy’ scenario for health and gender equality. Developments at the cross-roads of SDG 3 and SDG 5 are never ‘gender neutral’ and need attention for two reasons: to strengthen the health policy co-benefits and to prevent and mitigate adverse effects if gender equality is ignored. We introduce a conceptual model of researching co-benefits that expands the focus on macro-level co-benefits towards more complex governance processes and outcomes, including gender mainstreaming approaches. Selected empirical case studies consider major targets of SDG 5 and related SDG 3 sub-goals, illustrating different scenarios of implementation of health and gender co-benefits in a range of policy and governance contexts. The empirical cases illustrate that governance actions and intersectoral structures/institutional pathways shape the ‘windows of opportunity’ for co-benefits, yet co-benefits remain contested and must be re-assured, a lesson most recently learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Co-benefits; Gender Mainstreaming; Health Workforce; Maternity Care; Science System; Sdg 3 Health; Sdg 5 Gender Equality; Sexual Violence; Public Policy; Sustainable Development Goals; Benefit And Challenges; Cobenefits; Gender Equality; Gender Mainstreaming; Health Workforce; Maternity Care; Science Systems; Sexual Violence; Sustainable Development Goal 3 Health; Sustainable Development Goal 5 Gender Equality; Sustainable Development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010034146"

Around 21% of young women in the world married before reaching the age of 18. Every year, 10 million girls under the age of 18 are married. Child marriage causes lifetime suffering, and its abolition was one component of the Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality and empower women and girls. However; abolition of child marriage by 2030 will not happen because its prevalence in the community has remained stable. Objective: To assess the prevalence of child marriage and its associated factors among reproductive-age women from March 7 to April 5, 2022 in Harari Regional State, eastern Ethiopia. Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 7 to April 5, 2022 among the reproductive age group in the Harari Region state, Eastern Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to find study participants. Data were obtained by face-to-face interview using a pre-tested structured questionnaire, input into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using Stata version 16. The proportion with 95% confidence interval (CI) and the summery measure were used to report the prevalence. A multivariable logistic regression analysis model was used to examine associated factors, and the results were provided as an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval. Result: In this study 986 were responded to the interview, making response rate of 99.6%. The median age of study participants was 22 years. The prevalence of child marriage was 33.7% [95% CI: 30.8–36.7] in this study. Being a Muslim (AOR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.26, 4.19), diploma or higher level of education (AOR = 0.26, 95%CI =.10, 0.70), rural residence (AOR = 5.39, 95% CI = 3.71, 7.82), a marriage arranged by others (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.49, 4.82) and not knowing legal age of marriage (AOR = 4.49, 95% CI = 2.57, 7.85) were significantly associated with child marriage. Conclusion: According to this report, nearly one out of every three women engages in child marriage. The practice was more common among those with lower educational attainment, those who lived in rural areas, people who were unaware of the legal age of marriage, and those whose engagement was decided by others. Focusing on strategies that allow for intervention in these factors is beneficial in ending child marriage, which has a direct and indirect impact on women's health and educational achievement.","Associated Factors; Child Marriage; Ethiopia; Harari Region; Prevalence; Reproductive Age; Achievement; Adult; Age; Article; Child; Cross-sectional Study; Education; Educational Status; Ethiopia; Female; Gender Equity; Human; Human Experiment; Human Tissue; Interview; Major Clinical Study; Male; Marriage; Mental Capacity; Muslim; Prevalence; Rural Area; Structured Questionnaire; Sustainable Development Goal; Women's Health; Young Adult; Epidemiology; Adult; Child; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Marriage; Prevalence; Women's Health; Young Adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159383599"

Firstly, to identify gender-driven issues faced by the women in their community. Secondly, to demonstrate the strategies executed by solution providers in collaboration with beneficiaries’ groups. Thirdly, to analyze the impacts of the solution projects by utilizing four aspects: (i) deep (personal), (ii) clear (skills), (iii) wide (network), and (iv) high (system) as a measuring tool. In terms of research methodology, this study utilizes qualitative approach in data collection and analysis comprised of (i) observation, (ii) focus group discussion (FGD), and (iii) document analysis. Based on the analysis, three main findings were obtained in line with the objectives of this study. Firstly, main issues were based on local community experiences in education, household economy and health. Despite that, most of the issues require a national and global solution framework for the betterment of their community. Secondly, good synergy between solution providers (expertise and networks) and beneficiaries’ groups (local wisdom and motivation) is ‘the key to successes for solution projects. Thirdly, assessment on four aspects of this study shows the beneficiaries groups have been empowered through knowledge, skills, and networks. The most significant findings are that the beneficiaries’ groups established a system—as a registered and licensed groups on their own and as a part of the larger groups to ensure their sustainability—thus, ensuring ‘leave no woman behind’.","Development; Gender Dimension; Goal 5; Sabah Women; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174024815"

Despite the fact that Hero's Journey can be applied to a female protagonist, some female psychologists believe that a female protagonist cannot be compared to a male protagonist because the story does not depict what happens to a woman who embarks on a journey (Campbell 1949). Female characters are said to develop uniquely. These differences contribute to psychological variability in how men and women respond to story conflicts. According to Sustainable Development Goals number 5, it is urgent to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Due to Pandemic Covid-19, Over the Top (OTT) streaming platforms rose globally and shifting the streaming landscape. OTT is a video-on-demand service that provides streaming material as a single product and allows people to access content on numerous devices. With the emergence of technological influence, OTT platforms rely on algorithms and critical data to connect a film with its audience.

The available evidence on intimate partner violence in East Africa is limited Consequently, the objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and factors linked to intimate partner violence in East Africa. Methods The study utilized the most recent data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2011 and 2018/19 in 11 countries in Eastern Africa. A total of 59,000 women were included in the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to exmine factors associated with IPV. A mixed effect robust Poisson regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with intimate partner violence. The adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were employed to determine the presence of a significant association between intimate partner violence and the independent variables. Results In this study, the prevalence of intimate partner violence in East Africa was 43.72% with 95% CI 43.32% to 44.12%. In the mixed effect robust Poisson regression model:—Marital status, working status, parity, sex of household headed, wealth index, community poverty, and residence, were significantly associated with intimate partner violence. Conclusion The prevalence of intimate partner violence in East Africa is high as compared to the global prevalence 30%, which hinders The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically goal 5, aim to attain gender equality and empower women and girls worldwide by the year 2030 Women being previously married and cohabitated, working, having a high number of children, rural residents were positively associated with IPV and household and community wealth index and sex of household headed were negatively related with IPV in East Africa. Therefore, we recommend establishing effective health and legal response using an integrated policy approach and Special attention should be given to women who live rural and poorest to reduce IPV and to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goal 5.","Africa; Article; Attention; Child; Controlled Study; Demography; Female; Gender Equity; Health Survey; Household; Human; Human Experiment; Independent Variable; Inferential Statistics; Major Clinical Study; Male; Marriage; Married Person; Parity; Partner Violence; Poisson Regression; Poverty; Prevalence Ratio; Rural Population; Sustainable Development Goal; Epidemiology; Pregnancy; Reproduction; Africa, Eastern; Child; Female; Gender Equity; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Marital Status; Pregnancy; Reproduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168344653"

In alignment with this, several key international initiatives are making progress towards gender equality in the pharmacy profession. The pharmacy profession must support women and accelerate the progress of women in leadership positions in pharmacy. International and national pharmacy professional bodies can play a critical role in fostering the change required to improve gender equality in all regions and countries. The ongoing development, evaluation and implementation of policies and initiatives are critical to a profession that is increasingly becoming feminised. Furthermore, there is an imperative to deeply understand the gender-based barriers and develop evidence-based strategies and solutions to support women in pharmacy leadership. There is extensive literature and research on gender inequality and its impact on leadership outside pharmacy which could be used strategically for the profession to develop its own evidence based strategic position. Robust initiatives are needed to ensure that women at all levels including women in pharmacy leadership are empowered and encouraged to participate in their profession. This commentary seeks to generate and contribute to the debate to ensure the profession is proactive and deliberate in tackling the challenges that have traditionally impeded women reaching leadership positions and several critical actions as next steps are proposed. Action is needed to improve gender equality in pharmacy leadership and a profession-wide discussion on ways to progress the above proposed actions is critically needed.","Equality; Gender; Leadership; Pharmaceutical; Pharmacist; Pharmacy; Women; Child; Female; Gender Equity; Gender Inequality; Human; Leadership; Male; Note; Occupation; Pharmacist; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Vision; Pharmacy (shop); Female; Gender Equity; Humans; Leadership; Pharmaceutical Services; Pharmacy","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151973523"

Of particular importance is the cultivation of seaweed, particularly in East and Southeast Asia where seaweeds dominate the production market, and are key for coastal communities both as main livelihood source and as alternative or supplementary income to fisheries. Women play a crucial role in various segments of the seaweed aquaculture value chain; yet few researchers have empirically examined the gendered impacts of women's participation in aquaculture. Using the case study of Bantayan Island, in the Philippines, the objective of this study is to deepen our understanding of the impact of women's participation in aquaculture by specifically investigating their roles, remuneration and empowerment related to the production node of seaweed aquaculture. Adopting a novel research approach, which combines the outcomes of a focus group discussion and the data collected through two questionnaires, we provide a comprehensive and robust understanding of gender issues in aquaculture. Results of the economic analysis of labour costs indicate that women constitute most of the workforce but are paid less than men; the average gender pay gap is 55.4%. Moreover, our study finds that there is a well-established gendered division of labour in seaweed aquaculture. Greater female participation is not mirrored by more women in leadership roles and decision-making power in the workplace, although participation may have a positive impact on female intrahousehold empowerment. An important contribution of our analysis is to show that gender stereotypes in aquaculture production persist and they affect roles, wages and decision-making power. Acknowledging the fundamental contribution of women in aquaculture can inform the development of gender-sensitive indicators, supporting the measurement of progress towards relevant Targets of the fifth Sustainable Development Goal (“ Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls ”), therefore mainstreaming gender into resource management, and poverty alleviation","Coastal Communities; Mariculture; Philippines; Seaweed Farming; Sustainable Development Goals; Women In Aquaculture; Women's Empowerment; Coastal Zone; Empowerment; Gender Role; Mariculture; Seaweed Culture; Sustainable Development Goal; Womens Status; Bantayan Island; Cebu [(prv) Central Visayas]; Philippines; Visayas","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158041433"

However, there is paucity of studies investigating the association between women’s household decision making power and safer sex negotiation in Ghana. Thus, we examined the association between women’s household decision making autonomy and safer sex negotiation among Ghanaian women in sexual unions using the 2014 Ghana’s Demographic and Health Survey. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and multivariable logistic regression models were performed. Statistical significance was set at p <.05 at 95% confidence interval. The results showed high prevalence of safer sex negotiation among women with high household decision-making capacity (91.6%). Compared to women with low household decision making autonomy, those with high autonomy in household decision making were more likely to negotiate for safer sex (aOR = 2.06; CI = 1.32–3.21). Women aged 25–34 were more likely to negotiate for safer sex compared to those aged 15–24 (aOR = 1.50; CI = 1.07–2.11). Higher odds of safer sex negotiation were found among women with comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge (aOR = 1.49; CI = 1.09–2.05), women who had tested for HIV (aOR = 1.57; CI = 1.27–1.95) and those exposed to newspaper (aOR = 1.80; CI = 1.17–2.78) compared to those who had no comprehensive knowledge on HIV and AIDS, those who had never tested for HIV and those who were not exposed to newspaper, respectively. However, women who belonged to other ethnic groups and the Islamic religion had lower odds of safer sex negotiation compared to Akans (aOR = 0.68; CI = 0.48–0.96) and Christian women (aOR = 0.63; CI = 0.46–0.85). Women empowerment programmes need to be intensified to enable Ghanaian women with low household decision making autonomy to negotiate for safer sex with their partners. Ghana could achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly, SDG 3.7 (universal access to sexual and reproductive health services), and SDG 5 (achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) when household decision-making capacity among women is further strengthened.","Empowerment; Hiv And Aids; Household Decision-making Capacity; Safer Sex Negotiation; Women In Sexual Unions; Decision Making; Female; Ghana; Health Survey; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Negotiation; Safe Sex; Decision Making; Female; Health Surveys; Hiv Infections; Humans; Negotiating; Safe Sex","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148584287"

Performing a sensitivity analysis, the pay gap indicator was disclosed as the most relevant source of differences across European nations, for each of the three years considered. Subsequently the paper focuses on the temporal evolution of gender equality in three specific countries, i.e., Denmark, Germany and the Czech Republic, studying which elementary dimensions has the strongest impact on its dynamics. Interestingly it turns out that, in different countries, different indicators play the major role (related to women’s political representation, for Denmark and Germany, and to care giving, for Czech Republic). These sensitivity analyses are performed using posetic tools, to avoid the possible information loss of an aggregative procedures, involving the computation of composite indicators.

Article 6 in the Convention on the rights of women and girls is due to it being recognised globally that women and girls can experience multiple discrimination in all areas of life. Due to this disparity, UN Sustainable Development Goal 5, adopted in 2015, is to ‘achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’. Women with disabilities are known to experience more discrimination than men, and especially in relation to issues of sexuality and fertility, and more likely to experience exploitation and abuse (Atkinson et al., 2000; Scior, 2003). In recent years we have started to refer to the concept of intersectionality. It is a way to understand the layered forms of discrimination experienced due to multiple aspects of identity, such as gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or age. Many women with a learning disability and parents with a learning disability typically experience this multi-layered discrimination, as these stories here tell us.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198405723"

Starting from the historical and sociological frameworks of ucdw and equal pay, the article then analyses the link between the two in an attempt to understand whether the legal achievement of gender equality is hindered by treating the two goals separately. In particular, it looks at the wording of Goal 5.4 and questions its inclusion in Goal 5 (‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’). Using a legal and feminist lens, it examines the consequences of not including ucdw in Goal 8 (‘Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all’). One of the key findings is that the omission of ucdw from Goal 8 perpetuates the idea that this type of work is not part of the formal labour market, ultimately reducing the chances of it being included in national agendas worldwide. It is therefore argued that a different structure for the gender equality goals would increase the chances of ucdw finally being recognized as formal work and included in and regulated by labour law.","2030 Agenda; Equal Pay; Gender Equality; Gender Pay Gap; Sustainable Development Goals; Target 5.4; Target 8.5; Unpaid Care And Domestic Work","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180583772"

In 2022, the 66th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) addressed as a priority topic “gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes”. Women and girls, along with other vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples, and local communities, are the ones who “are the most affected by land and resource tenure insecurity and environmental degradation”, and they “disproportionately suffer the effects of biodiversity loss”. Despite achievements towards gender equality, women and girls are disproportionately affected by climate change and environmental degradation; this risk is not related to their biological sex, but rather to gender inequalities and gender norms that are rooted in societies. This chapter aims to demonstrate that it is not only exposure to certain hazards, disasters, pollutants and climate change but also the economic and social situation of women that reduces their ability to recover-from both major disasters caused by chronic emergencies and the chronic emergencies themselves-and perpetuates their marginalization and exclusion by limiting their access to climate justice. Due to the structural inequalities they face, women are hugely impacted by the climate crisis and environmental destruction. While the gender equality gaps in education, political and economic participation, and health are priorities of concern at the global level, climate change may increase violence against women and, more generally, slow violence. Against such a backdrop, the chapter aims to highlight how women can contribute significantly to cocreating resilience and adaptation strategies and solutions, given their understanding of the environment and their role as custodians of ancestral and traditional knowledge. This chapter elaborates on the future of women’s human rights from theoretical and empirical perspectives, shedding light on how to engender climate justice and access to justice, and embrace feminist concerns on matters of exploitation and domination of the environment in parallel to the domination and subordination of women by men in society.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172157806"

Indeed, public authorities and civil society are called to simultaneously be active and passive subjects, protagonists to intervene and recipients of the achievements reached with all the actions that serve any of the 17 proclaimed goals. One way of countering the slow progress is through the joint and coordinated effort of researching and teaching law in universities. With this commitment, this paper aims to analyse how international and EU legislation incorporates sustainability goals related to civil and procedural law. It is based on the consideration that the contents of civil law and procedural law comprise various institutions and regulations that materialise different SDGs. SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strongs Institutions have a particular impact on these areas and, more specifically, the aspects that relate to several of its targets. However, the legal implications, specifically in civil and procedural law, extend to many other objectives. This is the case of SDG 1, which aims to end poverty, SDG 5, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls or SDG 10, whose motto is to Reduce inequality within and among countries, which also impacts civil and procedural aspects. Among the civil and procedural institutions that develop these objectives, we can highlight the regulations that prevent inequalities arising from poverty in access to justice, the recognition of the legal capacity of persons with disabilities or the prohibition of child, early or forced marriages.","Civil Law; European Law; Procedural Law; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169002559"

This fifth goal aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. One of the SDG5 goals is to enhance the use of enabling technologies, particularly information and communications technology, to promote women's empowerment According to the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association's (GSMA) Connected Women Programme (2015), approximately 1.7 billion women do not own a mobile phone Enabling independent mobile ownership and use is currently one of the most important issues facing women with regard to SDG5. Therefore, this paper aims to explore various key issues and challenges related to mobile technology use and women's engagement in Malaysian higher education to achieve gender equality. A qualitative method was used for the study. Semistructured interviews were conducted with eight female and two male lecturers from public higher learning institutions in Malaysia. The research findings revealed that the respondents viewed the adoption and use of mobile technologies as critical to improving the use of ICT to promote the role of women in higher education. Therefore, the desire to work towards true gender equality within our academic communities and institutions is needed now, with the hope that more ways will be created beyond our universities, in our nations, and in our communities, to realise this human right in our world.","Higher Education; Ict; Mobile Technology; Sdg5; Women Empowerment; Engineering Education; Telecommunication Equipment; Enabling Technologies; Gender Equality; High Educations; Ict; Information And Communication Technologies; Malaysia; Mobile Associations; Mobile Technology; Sdg5; Women Empowerment; Sustainable Development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163877612"

This is worrying, considering the fact that it is women who are the majority, and they carry the brunt of the burden for most household duties. Zimbabwe adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and yet women continue to be hit hard by poverty. This was a qualitative study involving interviews and focus group discussions with 58 purposively sampled participants from Muchadziya village to determine the extent to which women in Muchadziya village are contributing towards sustainable development in Zimbabwe. The aim of this article, was to explore the ways in which women in Muchadziya village are contributing towards the alleviation of poverty. In the process, they will be contributing towards the attainment of some of the SDGs, such as the ones focusing on ending poverty in all its forms everywhere (SDG 1) and ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture (SDG 2). Using Africana womanism theoretical framework, the article maintained that African women should be perceived as agents, not subjects, of development and transformation in their communities. Findings indicated that women in Muchadziya village are selling various products and have sought markets in Beitbridge, Gweru and Zvishavane to sell them; others have set up shops and flea markets, and others make use of the land even though they do not own it to produce farm products to fight against poverty. The study concluded that women, despite being in difficult circumstances, are capable of contributing towards the achievement of the SDGs, particularly SDG 5 focusing on women’s empowerment and attaining gender equality. It is therefore recommended that women be given the necessary support to achieve more. Contribution: In a context where women are the most affected by poverty, Ndau women have proven that they can be agents of change by contributing towards the achievement of SDGs such as ending poverty in all its forms, zero hunger, education, gender equality and women’s empowerment and water and sanitation. Not much scholarly attention has been paid to the agency of women in Chimanimani in enhancing Zimbabwe’s sustainable development. This gap in literature might be influenced by the fact that African women, particularly women in rural areas, are perceived as beneficiaries or recipients of aid or development initiatives. As such, most programmes mainstreamed by aid or donor agencies in Africa have a specific focus on distributing aid to women and girl-children. Unfortunately, such programmes rarely seek to capacitate or empower their beneficiaries; hence, their interventions eventually disempower the intended beneficiaries.","Africana Womanism; Agents Of Change; Feminisation; Muchadziya Village; Ndau Women; Poverty; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85157974872"

In the field of public enterprises, a very peculiar subcategory is represented by health care companies as they carry out activities in the field of care and health in all of its direct or indirect meanings. Among the stakeholders of health care companies, the most relevant are employees and patients; social and gender reporting that focuses on them allows for the calculation of the distribution of income and expenditure between the genders and the empowerment of spending policies to eliminate discrimination. To understand the spread of non-financial reporting tools among national health facilities, an exploratory survey was conducted in the period August–September 2022. Processing the data available on the website of the Italian Ministry of Health, a database was built containing a list of 1064 health facilities spread throughout the country including public hospitals, research institutes, and accredited private clinics. Data showed that only 10% of the structures had conducted some form of social or/and gender reporting, highlighting the need to improve the spread of these kind of tools. In order to overcome the gap identified between scientific studies and corporate practices on gender and social reporting, we propose a framework for the construction of social and gender reporting in the health care sector. Based on the Italian standards, envisaged for the realization of social reporting and based on the regulatory provisions for public bodies on the reclassification of revenue and expenditure by gender, we propose a process of development for social and gender reporting that focuses on reporting the areas of intervention of health activity in which the gender dimension is equally represented.","Gender Auditing; Gender Budgeting; Gender Report; Health Care Companies; Social And Gender Reporting; Social Reporting; Gender Identity; Health Care; Public Administration; Public Sector; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Stakeholder","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145566636"

Evidence suggests that reproductive health rights influence contraception use. Women of Mali are noted to have limited control over their healthcare decisions. As a result, this study aimed at investigating the association between women’s healthcare decision-making capacity and unmet need for contraception in Mali. Methods: This study comprised 6593 women who participated in the 2018 Mali Demographic and Health Survey. Two binary logistic regression models were built. Whilst the first model (crude) involved healthcare decision-making capacity and unmet need for contraception, the second one was a complete model which controlled for all the socio-demographic characteristics. Sample weight was applied and Stata version 13.0 was used for all analyses. Results: Most of the women were not taking their healthcare decisions alone (92.8%). Nearly four out of ten of them indicated that they had unmet need for contraception (35.7%). Unmet need for contraception was high among women aged 45–49 (50.9%) and low among those aged 15–19 (19.2%). Unmet need for contraception was more probable among women who took their healthcare decisions alone compared to those who did not take their healthcare decisions alone [AOR = 1.35; CI = 1.08–1.70]. Compared with women aged 15–19, unmet need was higher among women aged 45–49 [AOR = 4.58, CI = 3.05–6.86]. Richer women had lower odds of unmet need for contraception compared with poorest women [AOR = 0.77, CI = 0.61–0.97]. Conclusion: Women who took their healthcare decisions alone had higher odds of unmet need for contraception. To increase contraceptive use in Mali, it is imperative to take women’s healthcare decisions into consideration to strengthen existing policies geared towards fertility control and improvement in maternal health to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 5. Sustainable Development Goal 3 seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages whilst Goal 5 aims at achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls.","Contraception; Family Planning; Mali; Reproductive Health; Unmet Need; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Birth Control; Child; Contraception; Contraceptive Behavior; Controlled Study; Decision Making; Demography; Family Planning; Female; Gender Equity; Health Survey; Human; Human Experiment; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mali; Maternal Welfare; Middle Aged; Reproductive Health; Sustainable Development Goal; Wellbeing; Health Care Delivery; Human Rights; Contraception; Contraception Behavior; Family Planning Services; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Human Rights; Humans","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136931261"

These development goals were premised on international human rights norms and institutions, thereby acknowledging the relevance of human rights in achieving each goal. Particularly, sustainable development goal 3, whose objective is to achieve universal health coverage, enhance healthy lives, and promote well-being for all, implicitly recognizes the right to health as crucial. Our focus in this paper is to discuss how promoting patients’ rights and enhancing effective nurse-patient communication in the healthcare setting is a significant and necessary way to achieve universal health coverage. Through a critical review of the empirical research evidence, we demonstrated that enhancing patients’ rights and effect nurse-patient communication will promote people-centered care, improve patients’ satisfaction of care outcomes, increase utilization of care services, and empower individuals and families to self-advocate for their health. These steps directly impact primary healthcare strategies and the social determinants of health as core components to achieving universal health coverage. We argue that without paying attention to the human rights dimensions or employing human rights strategies, implementing the other efforts will be inadequate and unsustainable in protecting the poorest and most vulnerable populations in the achievement of goal 3.","Patient-rights; Social Determinants Of Health; Sustainable Development Goals; The Right To Health; Universal Healthcare Access","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126224873"

Mobile phone ownership (MPO) can play a key role in bridging this digital divide and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”, “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”, and “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. Administrative district-level infrastructural and societal readiness to women's MPO in rural settings of Bangladesh may also influence the geospatial variation in their MPO status, which is still unexplained. In the context of rural Bangladesh, household heads substantially exert influence over women's decision-making process. However, the role of household heads' age and education on women's MPO is mostly unexplored. As in developing countries, women's MPO does not ensure its usage, investigating the possibilities of women's MPO on its usage has immense importance. Therefore, this study aims to revisit the correlates of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh and explain the administrative district-level geospatial variation in their MPO by controlling the effect of individual and household-level sociodemographic correlates of MPO. Further, this study attempts to investigate the possibilities of MPO on the extent of its usage. This study used the latest nationally representative cross-sectional data from Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019. This study reveals that the district-level readiness was a potential source of geospatial variation in the prevalence of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh. The lowest level of readiness was noticed in north-western Bangladesh. Comparatively elderly women with better education and media exposure had a considerably higher chance of MPO. Elderly household heads, especially male and less educated heads, hindered the MPO of women. This study identified MPO as a key determinant of its extent of usage. Moreover, to increase the MPO by a faster pace, strategies should target less empowered women, particularly those who lived in districts of lower readiness.","Determinants; Digital Divide; Empowerment; Geospatial Heterogeneity; Mobile Phone; Rural Bangladesh; Decision Making; Developing Countries; Bangladesh; Determinant; Digital Divide; Empowerment; Geo-spatial; Geospatial Heterogeneity; Information And Communication Technologies; Multilevels; Rural Bangladesh; Rural Women; Cellular Telephones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121907208"

Design/methodology/approach: The study develops static and dynamic panel data and empirical specifications and employs fixed effects and generalised method of moments (GMM) estimation techniques to estimate the impact of aggregate AfT and different categories of AfT on women empowerment. The study uses the Gender Inequality Index (GII) and Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) as the proxy measures of SDG-5, where the higher (lower) value of GII (GGI) implies higher gender disparities and lower women empowerment, and vice versa. Findings: The study finds that aggregate AfT and aid disbursement for the development of economic infrastructure, productive capability building and trade policy and regulations contribute significantly to achieve women empowerment by reducing gender inequalities concerning the labour force and political participation, education enrolment and better healthcare and by increasing gender gap index in relation to economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment. The impact of aggregate AfT and its different categories is found significant only in low- and lower-middle-income developing countries. The findings also indicate that the impact of AfT is not noticeably different across different regions of the world as well as the religious belief of the developing countries. Practical implications: The study recommends that more allocation of gender-responsive AfT, whether aggregated or disaggregated, significantly helps women empowerment and assists developing economies to achieve SDG-5. Originality/value: This study is one of the few that investigate the impact of aggregate AfT on gender inequality and women empowerment. This is the foremost study that examines the effects of each individual category of AfT on women empowerment vis-à-vis SDG-5.","Aid For Trade; Gender Equality; Generalised Method Of Moments; Panel data; Sustainable Development Goal 5; Women Empowerment; Aid Flow; Developing World; Empowerment; Gender Disparity; Gender Relations; Panel Data; Sustainable Development Goal; Womens Organization; Womens Status","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125895609"

In the mining industry, the contemporary concept of mapping artisanal and small-scale mining to the UN Sustainable Development Goals is a newer aspect of sustainability. SDG 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. However, while there have been initiatives to support gemstone mining in Tanzania and East Africa, to date, the role of women in the lucrative tanzanite M2M supply chain has been less visible and a missed opportunity. This is a concern, as in 2019, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, gemstone and precious metals accounted for an incredible 33.2% of Tanzania’s total exports. In contrast, in leading mining countries such as Australia and Canada, the participation of women continues to steadily advance, economically empowering the women involved. This article contributes a critical review of Tanzanian mining regulation and licensing practice in a historical and gender equality context. A qualitative research case study showcases artisanal small-scale (ASM) tanzanite gemstone miner and entrepreneur Pili Hussein, with a view to support the formulation of a Tanzanian regional, female-oriented, M2M tanzanite strategy. The developed world experience of increasing levels of gender participation in mining provides evidence of a reduced gender pay gap and enhanced mine safety practice when women are involved. This research finds that increased investment in supporting women to participate in the tanzanite M2M gemstone supply chain positively impacts SDG 5 in the country. Furthermore, given Tanzania’s economic dependence on mining and the exceptional characteristics of rare, single-source tanzanite (a generational gemstones), we conclude that gender equality and female mine-to-market (M2M) entrepreneurship has an undervalued, yet important, role to play in Tanzania’s future socio-economic development.","Africa; Artisanal Small-scale Mining; Entrepreneurship; Gemstone; Gender; Gender Pay Gap; Sdg 5; Sustainable Development; Tanzania; Tanzanite; Economic Development; Entrepreneur; Equity; Gemstone; Investment; Mining; Strategic Approach; Sustainable Development Goal; Australia; Canada; Tanzania","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127953491"

We examine whether the use of mobile phones shapes gender attitudes toward women’s participation in politics by making it more widely accepted that women hold institutional roles. We do so with micro-level data from the AfroBarometer, covering 36 African countries, and a multilevel modeling approach. Our results suggest that regular use of mobile phones is associated with more positive attitudes toward women’s participation in politics. The significant relationship—robust to the use of instrumental variable techniques—is observed only among women. This finding strengthens the idea that technology adoption on the part of women, by improving connectivity and expanding access to information, may be a successful lever to raise women’s status and promote societal well-being, ultimately contributing to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5, which seeks to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” Concurrently, the lack of a significant relationship for men highlights an important yet often neglected issue: policies aimed at changing gender attitudes are often targeted at women, but men’s attitudes can be stickier than women’s, thus requiring further efforts.","Africa; Gender Attitudes; Mobile Phones; Politics; Sdgs; Social Change; Technology; Women","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127450264"

Adolescents’ involvement is essential to achieve such equality and SDGs to develop peaceful sustainable societies. However, there are limited data especially from developing countries such as India to plan gender equality related programmes targeted at adolescents. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess gender equality related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours among 16 to 19 year-old adolescents from sixty villages of the Maharashtra state of India. Results: Data from 1306 respondents (667 females and 639 males) showed a mean score of 30 out of 44, suggesting an overall moderate gender equality score in rural adolescents. The majority of girls (68.3%) were in the high scoring group, whereas the majority of boys were in the moderate group (60.3%). Regression analysis showed that responses from boys were associated with lower scores compared to responses from girls by five points (adjusted β-coefficient: -4.99, 95%CI: -5.85 to -4.12, p<0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need to involve adolescents with a major focus on boys to improve gender equality in rural areas of Maharashtra. This will help introduce concepts of equality from an early age to educate boys, empower girls, and address gender-based discrimination and violence against girls and women.","Adolescent; Domestic Violence; Gender Equality; Gender-based Discrimination; India; Maharashtra; Sustainable Development Goals; Violence; Adolescent; Article; Attitude; Child; Cross-sectional Study; Developing Country; Domestic Violence; Female; Gender Equity; Human; Knowledge; Maharashtra; Major Clinical Study; Male; Rural Area; Sexism; Sustainable Development Goal; Village; Violence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204418953"

Such violence is as a result of gender inequalities among men and women in society. Women’s organizations in South Africa estimate that one in every three women is a victim of rape, while one in every six women is in an abusive domestic relationship. Violence against women (VAW) is a key issue in development and social policy (Sweetman, Violence against women. Oxford: Oxfam, 1998). Scholars highlight that women who are abused or have been exposed to experiences of violence cannot fully participate in community development (Babu and Kusuma, Violence against women and girls in the Sustainable Development Goals. Health Promotion Perspectives 7(1): 1–3.e, 2017). In addition, VAW increases health and legal demands and it is a waste of resources that could be used for other development projects. Using a conservative estimate, in a 2014 research Khumalo and others found out that gender-based violence costs South Africa between R28.4 billion to R42.4 billion per year (KPMG 2014). Such an economic strain has a negative impact on development. These and other arguments present the negative impact that violence has on development. Thus, addressing inequalities and particularly eliminating violence against women becomes a priority in the development agenda and achieving sustainable development goal ten which targets to reduce any form of inequality and sustainable development goal five in particular, which targets to achieve gender equality and empower all girls and women.","Religion; South Africa; South Africa Faith And Family Institute (saffi); Sustainable Development Goals; Violence Against Women","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199415858"

Some mothers suffer from depression, struggle to maintain social relationships, or do not have their voices heard in their communities. Sport has the potential to be a game-changer as it can liberate parts of the community from gender stereotypes and provide physical, social, and mental health benefits to participants. Mamanet is a team sport based on Newcomb Ball, which supports the emancipation of women and is the fastest growing sport among Israeli women. This chapter offers an overview of the key issues surrounding feminist theory and gender politics and details how Mamanet fits into the UNESCO Kazan Action Plan - Action 4: “Global observatory for women, sport, physical education and physical activity”. Moreover, the Mamanet sport model is linked to the sustainable development goal targets in health, education, empowerment of women, promotion of fair laws, achieve gender equality, and empower all women and girls. Mamanet has and will continue empowering women irrespective of age, race, religion, body stature, physical condition, emotional state, or socioeconomic background.

From a disciplinary point of view, the issue concerns women’s representation in the media and the repercussions it has in reinforcing stereotypes which lead to stagnant gender roles (points 5.4 and 5.5 of the Agenda). Mediascape in Italy still plays a crucial part in conveying stereotyped models that influence self-perception and the resulting personal and collective identity. In this context, Communication Design has a social and cultural dimension; we as designers have to intervene to develop new tools to change the ways of seeing, consuming and distributing images, in response to the 5.1 and 5.c goals. This work is focused on the ongoing research and experimentation activities conducted by the research group “dcxcg” (Communication Design for Gender Cultures). The group’s activity is placed at the intersection of Communication Design and Gender Studies, and its main goal is to offer a critical view of the forms of representation of gender and to support new communication models in the educational context working through a multidisciplinary perspective. Starting from the schematization of the short circuit created when media make use of stereotyped models to reach the target, amplifying and affirming the stereotypes themselves, the aim is to show where and in which ways communication design can intervene on this vicious circle, focusing on the educational dimension. This could be a contribution in generating positive actions, lifelong learning, and active encouragement in our society and a step toward gender equality and empowerment in a wider perspective.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142589547"

Along with a separately designated gender goal, the others in each of their directions provide for taking into account the gender dimension. Compliance with the most important principle of human development — gender equality — is considered by the UN as a prerequisite and condition for progress. Mid-term is here, but there remain large gender gaps across countries, and evidence shows the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a regressive impact on gender equality. The UN is developing activities to influence the course of events in order to prevent unforgivable losses from the arsenal of positive changes. Parliamentary hearings were held under the auspices of the UN aimed at improving political support and a comprehensive response to a sustainable recovery, intensifying the global discussion at the UN and in capitals around the world about sustainable development in the context of the ongoing pandemic. Near-universal reporting has been a UN achievement as the Voluntary Presentation of National Reviews has been presented for the seventh time. Of particular concern are the problems of discrimination against women scientists, which have become more acute during the pandemic.

There is an inextricable link and interpenetration between gender equality and sustainable development. Currently, international cooperation is being objectively updated, sometimes causing fierce disputes.","Coronavirus Pandemic; Covid-19; Gender Equality; Goal 5 “achieve Gender Equality And Empower All Women And Girls”; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; The Voluntary National Review Presentations; Un Document “transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda For Sustainable Development”; Un Women","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140397074"

The separation of the sexes often starts at home or at school, with girls being led to choices of gender-stereotypical careers or domestic life. This needs to be tackled from various angles, and one tool for this is non-sexist language. Sexist language makes women invisible and secondary by referring to them in the masculine and has been proven to negatively affect women in different ways, especially in employment. The United Nations includes best practices and strategies for non-sexist language in the Sustainable Development Goal number 5: “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” For the EU’s European Institute for Gender Equality, the goal of non-sexist language is to eliminate the ambiguous masculine and expressions that discriminate. Despite a concerted but inconsistent effort to eradicate sexist language by governments and international organisations, discrepancies in gender expression between languages do not necessarily require the application of different techniques. In an analysis of job vacancy titles of two international organisations, a variety of gender options was observed, with some languages showing a higher proportion of neutral-language forms. Our proposal for non-sexist drafting and translation of job advertisements calls for the systematic use of both genders alphabetically with variable profession nouns, and the use of the gender initials (f/m) after invariable, collective, and metonymic nouns, also in pronominal-gender languages like English. We believe that making women visible in vacancy titles will encourage female applications and establish mental connections that make women relate to the posts. Although gender specification of job advertisements might not be the only solution to closing the gender gap, it could contribute to the betterment of women in employment. More studies are necessary to show the advantages of applying non-sexist language in vacancies for the advancement of women in the labour market together with the adoption of simple rules in drafting and translation","Gender Gap; International Organizations; Job Advertisements; Non-sexist Language; Translation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130597808"

According to UN report titled 'The policy brief: The Impact of covid-19 on children, 2020' observes that, “the harmful effects of this pandemic will not be distributed equally. They are expected to be most damaging for children in the poorest countries, and in the poorest neighbourhoods, and for those in already disadvantaged or vulnerable situations.” The poorest and most disadvantaged children are particularly vulnerable, as they risk missing out on learning and failing to return to school. Early on in the epidemic, rural and high-poverty school districts experienced particularly difficult hurdles in maintaining one-on-one contact and regular check-ins between teachers and kids in a virtual setting. Girl children from low socioeconomic status endure the most discrimination from society. Male children are preferred more in India than female children for a variety of reasons. Reasons such as dropping out of school after puberty or for family reasons, doing household chores, caring for the elderly and siblings, being subjected to various forms of abuse and harassment, being forced into child marriage, and participating in labour activities are all common, but they have increased during this lockdown. According to United Nation's policy report of 2020, children are impacted by this crisis in three ways: through virus infection, the immediate socioeconomic ramifications of steps to curb the virus's propagation and end the pandemic; and the potential long-term consequences of deferring the Sustainable Development Goals' implementation. Gender disparities and inequalities obstruct progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): despite measured strategies and solutions, progress toward Goal 5 to ""achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"" remains restricted. The researcher conducted a review study by collecting around 25 research articles on the gender gap, gendered digital divide, gender inequalities faced by the girl child during this pandemic in rural India. The researcher adopted a secondary source in collecting research articles. The researched aimed to study the present socioeconomic situation of the girl children in rural areas, to analyse the existing factors associated with the gendered gap digital divide in rural areas and focus on bridging the gaps in achieving sustainable developmental goals and finally to increase awareness and strengthened the welfare of the girl child in rural areas with the aim of achieving sustainable developmental goals. Based on the findings of the review, the researcher believes that every child's contribution, regardless of gender or background, is critical, and identified specific gaps remaining As a result, resolving this issue requires a multisectoral approach; otherwise, the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic will leave a gap in society for female children, rendering the SDGs impossible, thus widening the gender gap internationally.","Covid-19; Developing Countries; Planning; Sustainable Development; Viruses; Developmental Goals; Digital Divide; Harmful Effects; Neighbourhood; Policy Briefs; Poorest Countries; Socio-economic Status; Socio-economics; Teachers'; United Nations; Rural Areas","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130538158"

Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search through several international electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest, and Science Direct was performed on September 2020, without a time limit. All studies aimed to develop and validate a measurement of women empowerment in sexual and reproductive health were included. The quality assessment was performed through a rating scale addressing the six criteria, including: a priori explicit theoretical framework, evaluating content validity, internal consistency, and factor analysis to assess structural validity. Results: Of 5234 identified studies, fifteen were included. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States. All studies but one used a standardized measure. Total items of each scale ranged from 8 to 23. The most common domains investigated were decision-making, freedom of coercion, and communication with the partner. Four studies did not use any conceptual framework. The individual agency followed by immediate relational agency were the main focus of included studies. Of the included studies, seven applied either literature review, expert panels, or empirical methods to develop the item pool. Cronbach's alpha coefficient reported in nine studies ranged from α = 0.56 to 0.87. Most of the studies but three lack reporting test–retest reliability ranging r = 0.69–0.87. Nine studies proved content validity. Six criteria were applied to scoring the scales, by which nine of fifteen articles were rated as medium quality, two rated as poor quality, and four rated as high quality. Conclusion: Most scales assessed various types of validity and Internal consistency for the reliability. Applying a theoretical framework, more rigorous validation of scales, and assessing the various dimensions of women empowerment in diverse contexts and different levels, namely structural agency, are needed to develop effective and representing scales.","Measurement; Psychometrics; Reliability; Reproductive Health; Validity; Women Empowerment; Article; Child; Coercion; Conceptual Framework; Content Validity; Cronbach Alpha Coefficient; Decision Making; Embase; Empowerment; Factor Analysis; Female; Gender Equity; Human; Internal Consistency; Male; Medline; Psychometry; Quality Control; Rating Scale; Reproductive Health; Sciencedirect; Scopus; Sustainable Development; Systematic Review; Test Retest Reliability; United States; Questionnaire; Reproducibility; Empowerment; Female; Humans; Psychometrics; Reproducibility Of Results; Reproductive Health; Surveys And Questionnaires","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121433676"

Twenty-four female middle and top managers of the logistics sector were interviewed via a questionnaire of 52 questions. The research for this study was based on Avery and Bergsteiner’s 2011 Honeybee and Locust Sustainable Leadership Model and strived to determine how female middle and top managers in the logistics sector in Spain perceived leadership in their workplace and whether these perceptions were aligned with Avery and Bergsteiner’s sustainability leadership model. Findings showed interesting results, indicating that the Spanish logistics industry seemed to be a mixture of bee-and locust-type leadership. Respondents agreed that organizations were not very open to knowledge sharing and indicated that there is still a considerable need for improvement with regard to leadership practices in the logistics sector. Finally, our study is innovative in the sense that sustainable leadership and gender equality are two elements that have not been researched together.","Honeybee Leadership; Locust Leadership; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Leadership; Female; Leadership; Management Practice; Perception; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Workplace; Spain; Apis Mellifera","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109353364"

We investigated the association between women's autonomy in household decision-making and safer sex negotiation (SSN) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 27 countries in SSA. Data were analyzed using Stata version 16.0 using descriptive statistics, chi square test, and logistic regression models. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval. The pooled prevalence of SSN in the 27 countries was 77.1%. Compared to women with low autonomy in household decision-making, those with medium (aOR = 1.30; CI = 1.23–1.37) and high levels of autonomy in household decision-making (aOR = 1.28; CI = 1.17–1.40) were more likely to have greater SSN. Those with primary (aOR = 1.35; CI = 1.28–1.41) and secondary/higher education level of education (aOR = 1.68; CI = 1.58–1.79) had higher odds of SSN, compared to those with no formal education. Women who were working had higher odds of SSN (aOR = 1.44; CI = 1.37–1.51) than those who were not working. Women in the middle (aOR = 0.93; CI = 0.87–0.99) and richer (aOR = 0.92; CI = 0.85–0.98) wealth status had lower odds of SSN, compared to those in the poorest wealth status. Women's autonomy in household decision-making is a significant predictor of SSN.

Sustainable development goal 5—Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls—deals very much with the notion of gender and how the relationship between genders is to be shaped in the future. In a critical reflection on previous and current approaches to balance power relationships and end gendered violence and discrimination it raises questions about the success of programmes targeted at women and girls only. As much as empowerment is an important part of the equation, ignoring the underlying power structures is going to render any empowerment programme only partially successful. What happens when we do take a look at power structures, organisational and societal patriarchal structures? What happens when we accept the notion that gender is fluid and rather a spectrum than a binary of female and male? Possible answers may become apparent when looking at concepts of intersectionality and compassion. Possible solutions may be suggested by holistic and inclusive concepts of diversity management.","Gender; Gender Fluidity; Intersectionality; Sdg 5; Structural Change","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218991392"

SDG 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus which corresponds to COVID-19 may be characterized as a pandemic. Globally, it is estimated that at least three million people died from the virus in 2020. This crisis has exacerbated the already existing inequalities between men and women in the areas of work, family, professional, health, access to technology, education, etc., which reflects that gender disparity disproportionately distributes responsibilities and economically rewards only some of the activities performed by women and girls. This article uses an evaluative methodology to show, from a gender perspective, the level of coherence of some of the most important measures issued by the Colombian government to avert the crisis in relation to SDG 5. It is concluded that these measures are insufficient and inconsistent with the content and scope of SDG 5 and its targets, even though theoretically this regulation aims to print gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, in practice, these have poor development and materialization.","Colombian Regulation; Covid-19; Gender Equality; Human Rights; Sustainable Development; Women","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164605321"

At present, the country has around 245 operational CR stations, over 100 of which are run by NGOs and local communities. Many CR initiatives in India continue to be led by women, while others work with women and groups oppressed on grounds of gender. CR exhibits the techno-social potential to empower women—to assert their right to communication spaces; to challenge the socially disempowering gender norms; to participate actively in the development processes; and to aspire for gender equality. Despite the demonstrated importance of CR for empowering women and promoting gender equality, till date there has been no systematic or conscious attempt in India to develop tools to build the capacities of CR stations for strengthening gender sensitivity in its policies, operations, and programming. A participatory project granted to UNESCO Chair on Community Media by International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC), being anchored by the author, seeks to address this gap by developing a Gender Sensitivity Manual for Community Radio. This manual will help community radio stations reduce gender inequalities, enhance women’s participation in every aspect of radio operations, and ensure that stations’ editorial content is gender sensitive. This will contribute directly to the achievement of key targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably, Goal 5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” This chapter presents a synthesis of some of the guides developed by international organisations with respect to gender issues and engagement of women in media and grassroots interventions that could help frame a roadmap for CR stations to strengthen gender-sensitive practices and content. By reviewing these guidelines alongside some of the conceptual frameworks on gender, community media, and participatory development, the author builds a preliminary outline of parameters that would eventually contribute to enhancing the use of CR as a platform to support gender equal practices in everyday life within the community.","Community Radio; Gender Equality; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Voice-capability; Women Empowerment","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160174537"

Increasingly, gender equality has become an important global concept in international debates and has been a “focus of intention” among academics, business, governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and society. However, much still needs to be done to achieve gender parity. As such, globally, gender bias and discrimination persist. Therefore, it is no coincidence that gender equality is a global issue and has emerged as one of the central UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Gender Equality (SDG5) exists to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” (United Nations, 2018). In addition to that, SDG5 suggests that “Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.” In the same vein, Fukuda-Parr (2016, p. 48) asserts that SDG5 “reflect[s] gender equality and women’s empowerment as a multi-dimensional process, going beyond straightforward outcomes, and incorporates targets related to gender-based violence, harmful practices, unpaid care work, voice, sexual and reproductive health and rights, economic resources, technology, and legislative change.”","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130970012"

We evaluate the association between women’s empowerment and the Composite Coverage Index (CCI), a weighted average of coverage of eight interventions in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH). We also assess whether these effects are modified by wealth. Methods We used Demographic and Health Survey data from 62 low and middle-income countries. Women’s empowerment was measured using the three domains (attitude to violence, social independence and decision making) of the survey-based indicator of women’s empowerment (SWPER). Analyses followed an ecological design. Meta-regression models were used to account for within-country uncertainty in the CCI. We also carried out meta-regression with wealth quintiles of households as the units of analyses and tested for interaction between wealth and each empowerment domain. Results We found positive associations between the three domains of SWPER and CCI at the country level. One standard deviation change in empowerment increased the CCI by 14.2 percentage points (attitude to violence), 15.3 percentage points (decision-making), and 16.3 percentage points (social independence). The association between social independence and CCI was modified by wealth: each additional standard deviation was associated with 21.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.0-29.6) and 8.7 (95% CI = 5.4-12.0) percentage points increase in the CCI among the poorest and the richest quintiles, respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that efforts toward the achievement of SDG5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) may support improvements in RMNCH in low and middle-income countries, especially among the poorest women and children.","Achievement; Article; Child; Child Health; Decision Making; Demography; Empowerment; Female; Gender Equity; Health Survey; Household; Human; Male; Middle Income Country; Newborn; Uncertainty; Violence; Developing Country; Income; Poverty; Questionnaire; Child; Developing Countries; Empowerment; Female; Humans; Income; Infant, Newborn; Poverty; Surveys And Questionnaires","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103745097"

To this end, this paper starts by reflecting on the main advances, unresolved challenges and social and labour landscape in present-day Spain in the field of gender equality, which largely motivated the passing of Royal Decree-Law 6/2019 of 1 March on urgent measures to guarantee equal treatment and opportunities between men and women in employment and occupation, and by briefly analysing the legal concept of equality plans of companies. The following is a discussion of the problems derived from the regulation in force until March 2019 and introduced into our legal system by Organic Law on Effective Equality of Men and Women of 2007, to analyse the new legal framework of equality plans. Some issues, such as the low relevance and even neglect of equality measures, the small number of companies affected by the obligation to have an equality plan, questions about the scope of the duty to negotiate and adopt an equality plan, etc. made a far-reaching amendment of the law indispensable. In relation to this new regulation, which came into force on 8 March 2019, this article seeks to address the impact it already has on our country's companies, since it clarifies the obligation to draw up and implement an equality plan that will affect more companies and workers, by changing the obligation from companies of more than 250 workers to companies of 50 or more. However, companies will be included in this obligation to draw up equality plans on a gradual basis. For this reason, Royal Decree-Law 6/2019 itself established a transitional period of 1 to 3 years from its publication in the BOE, depending on the size of the companies. We also analyse the most relevant issues for companies in relation to the fulfilment of their obligations, both with regard to the execution of a previous situation assessment, addressing its content with particular reference to the audit or wages, as well as the development, negotiation and implementation of an equality plan. Other aspects are also being taken into account in this paper, such as the number of workers, the establishment of a negotiating committee, the problems arising from the lack of legal representation of workers and possible appeals against ad hoc committees, the questions derived from negotiation processes without agreement or in which it is not negotiated in good faith, or the scope of the equality plan, without affecting the necessary regulatory development which should address some of the issues that are analysed. In any case, this regulatory development is foreseen in the current regulation. Another section of the article reflects on the positive and negative effects that negotiation, elaboration and implementation of equality plans have on businesses. Negative effects, such as the costs expected by companies to meet their obligations in terms of equality, both from a purely economic point of view and in time investment; but it is also necessary to emphasize the benefits that the implementation of effective equality plans and, in general, the introduction of a gender equality policy in the company could bring. Some of these benefits will be noticeable directly by companies in the short term (e.g. public procurement), but others will be investments in the medium or long term with the purpose of improving their reputation (e.g. through the Distinction ""Workplace Equality"") and building loyalty among their own human resources. Final conclusions and reflections are presented in order to complete this paper. The outcome of the analysis shows the need for regulatory development that provides clearer regulation of the issues raised throughout the present work, in order to guarantee greater legal certainty to companies and to avoid possible conflicts between social and business parties during the negotiation and elaboration of the previous situation assessments and equality plans, as well as during the monitoring and evaluation of them. Among the final reflections, the article stresses the importance that the development and implementation of the equality plan does not merely seek formal compliance with a statutory obligation, but it also becomes the main roadmap on equality for the company and an effective tool to end up with all situations of gender discrimination that were previously detected through situation assessment. To ensure that the implementation of the equality plan becomes a strong tool to transform gender relations in the company, ensuring equal treatment and opportunities between men and women and promoting the culture and training on equality, it is essential to achieve the real and firm commitment of the management and the senior management of the companies by being aware that the benefits that the implementation of equality plans could bring to them outweigh the costs. Thus, through an appropriate gender policy in companies, progress is made towards the goal of real and full equality between men and women in order to have a fairer and more egalitarian society, which makes it possible to contribute to the achievement of one of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030, specifically Goal 5 ""Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"".","Collective Agreement; Collective Bargaining; Discrimination; Effective Equality; Equality Plan; Gender; Initial Diagnosis; Legal Representation Of Employees; Wage Audit","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190573738"

Drawing on the stories of women working informally and formally, and in the public and private sectors in the Tunisian tourism industry, maternity protection is presented as a major challenge to the UNWTOs assertion that tourism can aid in the attainment of SDG 5: ‘achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’ (UNWTO, 2016). Women’s stories highlight the incompatibility of policy with pregnancy, presented here as culturally bound, and tourism.","Fictional Ethnography; Maternity Protection; Tourism; Tunisia; Women’s Work","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122102200"

Religious and customary laws often become the basis to legitimize the practices of child marriage. According to UNICEF in 2016, Indonesia ranked the seventh in the world and the second in ASEAN for the highest rate of child marriage. Child marriage is a manifestation of gender inequality, especially for female. Indonesia, as one of the member countries of the United Nations (UN), has ratified the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) program issued by the UN to eradicate the practice of child marriage occurring within the society. One of the purposes of the SGDs program is to “Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls.” Hence, it is expected that from this program, Indonesia will have a zero rate of child marriage by 2030. This article discusses child marriage practices occurring in Indonesia as well as efforts taken by the Indonesian Government (both the central government and regional government) in an attempt to eradicate the problem of child marriage.","Child Marriage; Gender; Indonesia; Marriage; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098665865"

Improving maternal health was one of the eight goals; Millennium Development Goals four (MDG 4) and five (MDG 5) are related to maternal and child health. The fourth goal (MDG 4) aimed at reducing child mortality by two thirds between 1990 and 2015, while the fifth goal (MDG 5) aimed to improve maternal health by reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by three quarters between the same years (WHO, Trends in maternal mortality (1990-2008). WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and World Bank, Geneva, 2010, p. 3). However, they did not meet these promises because the essential role of information and communication was given an afterthought. The United Nations has now embarked on Sustainable Development Goals in which goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, while goal 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. To this end, the objectives of the chapter were investigation of the maternal-child health patients’ knowledge, influence of provider-patient communication, and maternal health communication strategies. The study used the setting of Busia County in Kenya and a review of available literature. Data was analyzed thematically. Findings indicate that lack of maternal-child health knowledge leads to non-utilization of skilled facility health. From the study, we conclude that appropriate communication strategies if mainstreamed in maternal health campaigns can enhance utilization of skilled facility health care, thus accelerating the achievement of MDGs 4 and 5. The study recommends that communication strategies in Africa should foster participation and strengthening of community structures to enhance attaining MDGs 4 and 5. The study was grounded in the social cognitive theory postulated by Albert Bandura. This theory posits that although environmental stimuli influence behavior, individual personal factors such as beliefs and expectations also influence behavior change.","Communication Strategies; Maternal Health Campaigns; Millennium Development Goals; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089644754"

It explores how three key drivers shaped its contours and the effectiveness: (1) context of socioeconomic and political environment; (2) institutions; and (3) the processes of movement building. While feminist mobilizing led to significant advances in the SDGs relative to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), important unresolved barriers of financing and political opposition to women's human rights and gender equality remain and will require continued feminist mobilizing. This paper argues for the need to locate feminist mobilizing for the SDGs in the context of the history and persistence of gender inequality and violations of girls’ and women's human rights, and the struggle against these violations. This history is located within economic, social and political environments that are sometimes more open to progressive social change but often, as in the current global conjuncture, may not be.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060751835"

The SRHR Africa Trust (SAT) is a regional non-governmental organisation (NGO) which has established innovative youth hubs for 12-25 year-olds in Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Hubs provide safe and secure physical spaces as well as virtual online spaces for youth dialogue, networking, capacity building and collaboration. Six youth (aged 16-27 years) who lead SRHR advocacy initiatives in the region were purposefully selected/ invited to participate in a virtual roundtable discussion to share their perspectives on global (SDGs) and continental (Agenda 2063, Maputo Plan of Action) commitments to SRHR. Thematic analysis of data was carried out. The participants’ contributions revealed that there were some progressive shifts in discourse, for example, understandings of gender, during the discussion. There were also noted weaknesses, such as limited knowledge and engagement of Pan-African discourse compared to their awareness of the SDGs. Young feminists stated that given present societal constraints, specifically cultural norms and lack of political representation, it is unlikely that the SDGs will be achieved. Youth feminism and agency in menstrual health and working with positive adolescents, demonstrated the potential to shift the adolescent and youth gender and SRHR terrain on to stronger activist ground but this is subject to further ongoing and meaningful engagement.","Africa; Gender; Sexual And Reproductive Health Rights (srhr); Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Youth","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078003484"

In particular, SDGs’ goal 5, “Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls” (UN 2016). However, persistently high gender gap was found in many countries around the world whether they are developed or developing. The 2016 Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), which examines gender inequality across four key areas of health, education, economy and politics, showed that the gender gap widened in many countries, and the gap in “economic participation and opportunity” showed the largest gender gap compared to health, education and political participation (World Economic Forum 2016). Interestingly, the GGGI do not match the global ranking of countries based on their GDP size, GDP per capita, or even the level of poverty. Thus, in order to deal with the underlying causes of deep-rooted and persistent gender inequality we must develop more culturally nuanced and contextualized approaches in the SDGs to tackle gender inequality (Song & Kim 2013). Gender inequality is simply not acceptable in the world where half of the world’s citizens are not provided with the same rights as the other half. It is also economically less productive to rely on only half of the world’s labor force to help eradicate poverty. Education, employment, and full empowerment of women and girls must be a priority for the SDGs.","Empowerment; Gender; Inequality; Sustainable Development Goals; Un; Education; Employment; Empowerment; Gender Disparity; Sustainable Development; United Nations; Womens Status","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025109552"

The universal character of the goals and the emphasis on addressing the systemic and structural dimensions of gender inequality represent a significant advance over the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The stand-alone goal to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”—SDG 5—includes targets on ending violence and harmful practices against women, addressing women’s unpaid care work, as well as addressing women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, amongst others. The full implementation of these goals would substantially reduce gender inequality in these areas, but that will only happen with adequate resourcing. The book therefore offers some ideas on financing for gender equality, drawing on over two decades of GRB policy and practice. It does not present GRB as a silver bullet but rather grapples with some of the tensions of this work and asks important questions about future direction.","Economic Liberalization; Gender Equality; Millennium Development Goal; Silver Bullet; Sustainable Development Goal","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183379017"
