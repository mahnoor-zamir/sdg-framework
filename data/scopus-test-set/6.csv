In Bizerte, Tunisia (Southwest Mediterranean region), this need is particularly urgent due to rising demand and contamination risks, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which seeks to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This research aims to enhance groundwater management and assess contamination risks in Bizerte using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A multidisciplinary approach was adopted, integrating multi-criteria analysis and a spatially referenced hydrogeological information system. Eight thematic layers, geomorphology (0.15), slope (0.10), lineament density (0.12), drainage density (0.10), land use/land cover (0.08), precipitation (0.20), lithology (0.15), and soil (0.10) were analyzed for their impact on groundwater availability. Weights were assigned via an AHP-based pairwise comparison matrix and integrated using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to generate a groundwater potential map. The analysis revealed that approximately 60% of the area has significant groundwater potential, with 30% classified as high potential zones and 30% as moderate potential zones. Vulnerability to contamination was assessed, showing that 20% of the area is at risk, primarily due to agricultural activities, industrial discharges, and inadequate waste management. The results highlighted the need for continuous monitoring and effective management strategies, underscoring the importance of a holistic approach in groundwater management to provide a robust decision-making framework.","Ahp; Bizerte; Contamination; Groundwater Potentiel; Vulnerability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216208753"

The system, designed to collect rainwater from a 200 m2 roof area with an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm, is capable of collecting approximately 216,000 L of rainwater annually. To ensure water quality, a multi-stage filtration and UV disinfection process was implemented. Remote monitoring and control through a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system were incorporated to track water quality parameters such as pH, water level, and electrical conductivity in real-time, ensuring the safety of the collected water for drinking purposes. The system achieved significant reductions in microbial contaminants, with general bacteria levels dropping from 6270 CFU/ml in untreated rainwater to 80 CFU/ml after treatment, meeting WHO drinking water standards. Additionally, the study highlights the economic feasibility of the RHS, showing potential cost savings through the use of local materials and labor. This research supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6), which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. By demonstrating that rainwater can serve as a reliable, eco-friendly alternative to traditional water sources, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water is limited, this system offers a sustainable and scalable solution to global water challenges. The successful integration of technical, economic, and social aspects ensures that the RHS contributes to both environmental sustainability and social equity, helping to advance SDG6 in regions facing water scarcity.","Drinking Water; Harvesting; Rain Water; Remote Communication; Water Quality; Energy Conservation; Sustainable Agriculture; Advanced Monitoring; Annual Rainfall; Multi-stages; Rain Water; Rainwater Harvesting; Rainwater Harvesting System; Remote Communication; Sejong Cities; South Korea; Water Scarcity; Environmental Management Systems; Annual Variation; Data Acquisition; Drinking Water; Precipitation Intensity; Rainwater; Water Management; Water Quality; Water Resource; Sejong","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003857194"

Pastoral systems in Southern Kazakhstan are facing a critical groundwater shortage, with 56.5% of pastures currently unused due to limited water access, jeopardizing around 2 million head of livestock and the region’s food security. This study presents the first comprehensive groundwater assessment in over 40 years, integrating hydrochemical analysis (55 samples) and field surveys conducted in the Almaty and Zhetysu regions. Key findings include: the total water demand for livestock is estimated at 53,735 thousand m3/year, with approximately 40% of samples exceeding WHO guidelines for total mineralization. It was determined that 45% of exploitable groundwater reserves in the Almaty region and 15–17% in the Zhetysu region are suitable for irrigation. This study also provides updated hydrogeological data, identifying three priority aquifer systems. A novel Groundwater Sustainability Index for pastoral zones of Central Asia is introduced, demonstrating that strategic aquifer development could expand watered pastureland by 30–40%. These findings directly inform Kazakhstan’s Agricultural Development Plan through 2030 and provide a replicable framework for sustainable water management in arid regions.

Therefore, this study primarily examined the effect of public spending on WASH adoption. The moderating role of governance quality in the nexus among public spending and WASH adoption was equally assessed. The underlying relationships for a global panel of 45 countries over the 2000–2022 period are unravelled with the help of the system Generalised Method of Moments, Driscoll–Kraay robust standard errors and the generalised least squares estimation techniques. Results from various approaches show that public spending has a statistically significant negative effect on WASH adoption. Moreover, the interactive regressions show that public spending negatively interacts with governance to produce a negative net effect of −0.319. The underlying negative effects are apparent when some governance thresholds are exceeded. These thresholds are critical points that when reached, complementary policies are needed in order to maintain the unconditional positive effect of public spending on WASH adoption. It follows that the complementarity between public spending and governance is a sufficient and necessary condition for the promotion of WASH adoption exclusively below certain governance thresholds. Contingent on the empirical results, policymakers are advised to tailor public spending to more conveniently target local-based WASH initiatives in order to limit bureaucracy and broad-based policies. Besides, the local population should be endowed with the ability to sanction elected officials when WASH measures are not effectively implemented. Beyond the economic and political governance consideration related to WASH, institutional governance should also be improved at the local level, to the extent that ensuring the respect of interactions between the citizens and the State in the promotion of WASH is also enforced at the local level.","Bureaucracy; Drinking Water; Governance Approach; Hygiene; Least Squares Method; Local Government; Local Participation; Public Spending; Sanitation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201688893"

Permanent solutions to deal with faecal sludge are required to solve the sanitation crisis and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” by 2030. Full-scale pyrolysis of faecal sludge in developing countries is fast becoming a safe and long-term option. Pyrolysis not only eliminates pathogens within the sludge but produces biochar as an end product which has the potential as a soil amendment to increase crop yield. In general, faecal sludge biochars have high pH values, high ash contents, and high macro-and micronutrient concentrations. Compared to biochar from lignocellulosic materials, faecal sludge biochar contains less carbon and exhibits lower porosities, and lower surface areas. However, evaluating the properties of faecal sludge biochar is difficult due to the different technologies used in collection, storage, and transportation of the feedstock. Differences in faecal sludge characteristics based on location, climate, age of the sludge, type of sanitation technology and seasonality are also factors in determining the properties of faecal sludge biochars. These factors contribute to the difficulty in describing faecal sludge biochar properties in general terms, and there is an argument to be made that characteristics of large-scale faecal sludge biochar should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The conclusion of this review is that future research should concentrate on short-term and long-term field studies of faecal sludge biochar application to different soil types.","Agronomic; Biochar; Faecal Sludge; Resource Recovery; Sanitation; Soil; Biochar; Circular Economy; Concentration (composition); Pyrolysis; Sanitation; Seasonality; Sludge; Trace Element; Waste Management","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001074183"

In this regard, solar photocatalysis, driven by freely available sunlight using low-cost, reusable photocatalysts, is a promising approach. In this context, we present a novel full-solar-spectrum photocatalyst with promising efficiency attributed to its laddered heterojunction and Ag-based plasmon enhanced activity. Specifically, it comprised Co2+-doped zinc-ferrite nanoparticles embedded on zinc oxide sheets that were later conformally coated with a small weight fraction (2.5%) of Ag under sunlight. The photocatalyst was optimized for different synthesis methods, post-synthesis temperatures, and different compositions with orange G as a model pollutant. Unlike previous reports, without any scavengers, the photocatalyst was effective for highly polluted water with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of ∼740 ppm, eliminating 66% of it within an hour. We have coined a new term, solar photo-oxidation efficiency (SPOE), to describe the photocatalyst's performance. SPOE was directly dependent on the pollutant concentration and was found to be 72% for 400 ppm ciprofloxacin, with an apparent quantum yield of 36%. The promising activity of our photocatalyst continued even after several reuses. The generation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals was confirmed by respective confirmatory tests. Scavenging tests indicated the highest contribution of superoxide radicals and holes in photodegradation. Our photocatalyst is promising and holds enormous potential for use in the treatment of diverse pollutants.","Nanosheets; Nanospheres; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic Activity; Photolysis; Quantum Yield; Reusability; Scavenging; Water Pollution; Zno Nanoparticles; Ferrite Nanoparticles; Low-costs; Oxidation Efficiency; Photo Oxidation; Solar Photocatalysis; Solar Spectrum; Superoxide Radical; Sustainable Management; Zinc-ferrite; Zno Nanosheets; Photodegradation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000769837"

The agricultural sector is crucial for Colombia as it contributes to food security, the economy, and the Nation’s employment rate. However, the agricultural sector is challenged by the environment and its natural resources, especially water in water abstraction and soil in terms of degradation and land cover change. Additionally, climate change exacerbates these challenges by altering precipitation patterns, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, and further stressing water and soil resources, making sustainable management even more critical. The Resource Nexus approach comes into play to cope with and mitigate such challenges. Combined with social equity to advance the sustainability of agriculture, the Nexus approach demonstrates pathways towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger)in synergies with other SDGs, like SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). This paper addresses the dual challenge of improving natural resources management and population vulnerability reduction in the frame of environmental conflicts and population inequalities that severely affect the resilience of food systems. In line with principles of inclusion and gender equity, the methodology developed here aims to identify Colombia's productive regions that would benefit from enhanced management at the landscape level, the Resource Nexus approach. With the use of geographic information systems (GIS), this research spatially evaluates the (i) impact of land-use changes and the land-use fragmentation due to resource overuse, (ii) the provision of ecosystem services under different uses of natural resources and suggests ecosystem services planning as a methodology for municipal ecosystem-based management, (iii) climate change and the anthropogenic impacts on agricultural productivity in Colombia at the municipality scale. The results indicate significant environmental changes over the past few decades, including reduced natural forests and increased agricultural land. This shift has coincided with a decrease in freshwater availability. Additionally, there is a concerning trend of agricultural expansion into protected areas, highlighting the ongoing pressures on natural resources and the need for sustainable management practices.

Such a network of sensors, will generate data over time constituting a dataset on which computer intelligence algorithms can work to detect abnormal behaviour, especially leakages. Unfortunately in Brazil the initiatives in monitoring WDS through sensors are very incipient. Since we don’t have a real dataset with sensor information over time yet, in this work we aim to provide a solution to this part of the problem through simulation. In 2018, LeakDB [1] was presented as a “benchmark dataset for leakage diagnosis in water distribution systems”, in fact a very important and interesting work. However it has some drawbacks, especially inconsistent data, which prevents its use as a solid basis. In this paper we improve LeakDB implementing LeakG3PD, opening the path to analyze the viability of different solutions in water management, with special focus on leakages.","Leakage Detection And Isolation Algorithms (ldia); Leakdb; Leakg3pd; Simulated Dataset; Water Distribution Systems (wds); Information Management; Availability Management; Distribution Systems; Leakage Detection; Leakage Detection And Isolation Algorithm; Leakdb; Leakg3pd; Simulated Datasets; United Nations; Water Distribution System; Water Distributions; Water Distribution Systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210887161"

The hybrid land use classification technique for classifying Landsat images; Cellular-Automata Markov (CA-Markov) for prediction of the 2035 and 2050 LULC; and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for hydrological modeling were employed in the analyses. New hydrological insights for the region: The findings revealed that from 1990 to 2020, significant alterations in the hydrological regime occurred due to historical LULC changes in the Welmel watershed, which are expected to continue in the 2035 and 2050 periods. Forest cover loss and expansion of agricultural areas, which occurred from 1990 to 2020, have resulted in increased annual flow (6.18%), wet seasonal flow (10.21%), and surface runoff (25.32%), and reduced dry seasonal flow (6.34%), groundwater flow (17.17%, and evapotranspiration (0.36%). The 2035 and 2050 LULC indicate further increased annual flow, wet seasonal flow, and surface runoff, and reduced dry seasonal flow, groundwater flow, and evapotranspiration. The study also stated the hydrological impacts of the LULC changes at the sub-watershed scales. More noticeable changes in hydrological components have been observed at the sub-watershed scale, mainly associated with the uneven spatial distribution of LULC changes. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, water resource managers, and local communities in formulating strategies to enhance water resource management practices in the Welmel watershed and similar regions. It could also be for researchers and Academia who can be benefited and it can be used to supplement global goals like Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.","Land Use/land Cover (lulc) Change; Swat Model; Water Balance; Water Resource Management; Welmel Watershed","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186405322"

This research addresses the problem of water quality assessment by utilizing advanced regression techniques for predicting the Water Quality Index (WQI) score, a key indicator which reflects overall effect of various pollutants present in water bodies. This study presents a novel approach of integrating Gradient Boosting and Ridge Regression through a Stacking Regressor, using environmental data to predict WQI. It is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared metrics, demonstrating consistency and robustness in WQI prediction. In contrast to the traditional methods, our approach incorporates sophisticated ensemble methods and optimized feature engineering approaches to address the problem of dataset imbalance and to learn complex non-linear dependencies among different water quality variables. As a result, the approach significantly enhances the accuracy of water quality evaluation, which is key in ensuring proper management of water resources, as dictated by SDG 6.

One of the indicators of the goal is the proportion of population using a hand-washing facility with soap and water i.e., the percentage of people living in households that have a handwashing facility with soap and water available on the premises. As a standard hygiene measure to prevent infections including the new coronavirus, WHO advises the public to practice handwashing with soap and water and published a guideline on proper handwashing techniques. In 2017, 42 countries including South Africa had less than 50% access to basic handwashing facilities (including soap and water) at home. Three years later, in 2020, 44.8% of South Africans were with basic handwashing facilities including soap and water in their homes. Therefore, this study looked at the prevalence of having a handwashing place/facility for households in South Africa in 2022 and the key predictors of having a handwashing place in South African households. Data used were from the 2022 South African General Household Survey, a nationally representative survey. Handwashing with water and soap after defaecation was used as a measure of having facilities for handwashing including water and soap. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to describe the characteristics of the sample, prevalence, and predictors of handwashing facilities with soaps and water amongst South Africans. Of the 19,351 households who participated in the study, 57.8% (10,801) were male headed households. About 0.3% (n=43) of the households were headed by children from 14-17 years. After defaecation, 34.9% (n=5448) of household members used only water to clean their hands, 3.7% (n=550) clean their hands with hand sanitizer or wet wipes, 0.6% (n=106) did not clean their hands while 60.8% (n=8914) used soap and water to clean their hands on their premises. The older the age of the head of household, the higher the percentage of members of the household who washed their hands with soap and water. Conversely, the poorer the household, the less the percentage of household members who used water and soap to wash their hands after defaecation. The use of any form of flush toilet /water closet, not sharing the toilet with the neighbour, safe waste removal and living in the urban areas were the predictors of handwashing with soap and water. In conclusion, this study showed that the percentage of South Africans with handwashing facilities (including soap and water) increased from 2020 when it was 44.4% to 60.8% in 2022. The predictors highlighted should be the focus for policy makers to further increase the accessibility of the South African population to handwashing facilities.","Handwashing; Sdg 6.2.1; Soap; South Africa; Water","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210597015"

Water and sanitation utilities, as important service providers, play a key role to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”, Goal 6 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6). To help achieve SDG 6, water utilities need to increase their productivity and become more efficient. This will require tapping into new approaches, technologies, and solutions to meet emerging needs. Consequently, the role of chemical engineers in the water and wastewater treatment field is becoming more critical, as their expertise is needed to develop materials, technologies and design multistep processes required to treat water from complex streams and sources. In this chapter, we present a review on recent advancements in technologies for wastewater treatment. Research trends and innovation in physical, chemical, and biological processes for wastewater treatment are discussed. Current gaps and barriers are also identified. Moreover, the contribution of chemical engineers to the generation of knowledge in the field is evaluated. While chemical engineers have consistently contributed to the improvement of water and wastewater treatment processes, other disciplines are contributing in greater proportion to clean water and sanitation research. However, chemical engineering research seeking technological strategies to improve sanitation and water quality can be an essential component in the efforts to reach SDG 6.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207593592"

Some of the targets set to be accomplished by 2030 include to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. The demand for water has increased tremendously in the urban areas as in Bhubaneswar due to escalating population growth in the past decades and surge of migrants from all parts of the country, in turn soaring the water quality issues, as recently stated by the Public Health Laboratory, Bhubaneswar in 2019. The people lacking permanent settlement are mostly devoid of municipality water supply and the shallow tube wells are available source for fulfilling the demand of water. Researchers have warned that the pollution of shallow ground water of Bhubaneswar is a major threat at the moment. In this context a study has been done in the existing shallow tube wells of different wards of Bhubaneswar, mostly used by the people of low-income group for drinking water purposes. Water samples have been collected from different shallow tube wells using random sampling technique. The parameters like PH, Alkalinity, Total Hardness, Conductivity, DO, TDS, BOD and Chloride have been measured and Water Quality Index has been calculated using Weighted Arithmetic Mean Method. The analysis reveals that the major quality deterioration has occurred Chirkhal Toli Slum tube well in ward no 1 and in the existing tube wells of ward no 2 in Prashanti Vihar, Munda Sahi, KIIT Campus and Sikharchandi Slum Area. Similarly, out of four samples in ward no 3, the tube well of Patia village indicates deterioration in the quality. However, the shallow tube well of ward numbers 6, 7 and 8 displays good water quality.","Availability Management; Equitable Access; Permanent Settlements; Population Growth; Sustainable Management; Tubewells; United Nations; Universal Access; Urban Areas; Water Quality Issues; Water Hardness","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206439665"

There are currently over 4.2 billion people not having safe sanitation access and over 2.2 billion people without access to safe drinking water. As a result of Climate Change natural disasters like droughts and floods has become more frequent. Eighty percent of the world’s wastewater is simply released back into nature. Wastewater management encompasses many tasks with the overarching goal of fostering efficient and ethical water usage and its treatment. AI has shown potential use in the field of vehicular production, banking, finance, agriculture, exploration of space, and AI creativity. Due to its obvious benefits in terms of efficiency, speed, and autonomy—all of which minimize the need for human intervention—artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being incorporated into the wastewater treatment sector. For ensuring sustainable management of wastewater UNEP is determined to focus on global action which requires collaboration amongst UN and Non-UN countries. Both developed and developing countries are to adopt and effectively implement strict regulations, Infrastructure and finance for wastewater management. The present study highlights the issues and challenges to ensure the safe and effective deployment of artificial intelligence in this critical sector.

The means to achieving these outcomes is treating organic wastes using anaerobic digestion to produce a methane-rich gas, biogas. In the UK/EU, regulatory controls and fiscal incentives have been applied to promote the use of anaerobic digestion to treat such wastes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling food waste, while simultaneously producing renewable electricity, heat and biomethane. A brief review of the anaerobic digestion process and main process types is provided, in addition to considering different feedstock types. Reference is made to two anaerobic digestion technology scenarios that sought to identify the optimum technology combination to deliver gases/fuels to the commercial marketplace, based on the efficiency of energy production, energy capacity, avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and capital/operating costs. Project capital and operating costs vary with feedstocks, technology combinations and the outputs/end-uses, and developers/investors need to compare the estimated capital/operating costs of proposed projects to assess their economic viability. Using different metrics, it can be seen that organic wastes of different types can be treated successfully using wet/dry digestion technologies to produce biogas for on-site/off-site use as a fuel for gas engines/fuel cells, upgraded to biomethane for grid injection and/or liquefied for off-site use, or converted to hydrogen. The choice of plant size and technology combination/option are influenced by the choice of feedstock(s), which in turn influences both the capital and operating costs of a proposed plant and hence its viability. Anaerobic digestion is a technically and financially proven option, able to assist developed and developing countries to support many of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, including helping end poverty; zero hunger by promoting sustainable agriculture; ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation; and ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy; responsible consumption and production; climate action to combat the adverse impacts of climate change. The main focus of this chapter is how the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes provides positive outputs across a number of sustainability goals while minimizing the adverse environmental impacts of landfilling such wastes.","Anaerobic Digestion; Biogas; Energy; Food; Un Sustainability Goals; Wastes","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201819892"

However, these solutions often focus primarily on managing water quantities to improve water productivity in agriculture, urban, and industrial sectors. Effective and sustainable water use, however, requires monitoring and management of both water quantity and quality. Traditionally, water quantity and water quality have been managed separately, often by different government agencies with different missions and limited interaction. Ensuring sufficient water quantity for agriculture and food production often takes precedence over managing water quality. Water accounting, as a tool for allocating and managing water quantity is now widely accepted and numerous examples of successful implementation exist worldwide. However, the concept of incorporating water quality into water accounting has not yet been widely promoted. Measuring both quantity and quality in the same water bodies is a fundamental principle of assessment of impacts on water quality through the determination of loads. The load is the amount of a given substance or pollutant for a given period of time. Using the key steps necessary for the development of a water quality monitoring and assessment programme, a framework has been developed that can be applied to water accounting projects using typical water accounting applications. Two examples of potential applications are used to consider the technical, institutional, and financial requirements. Implementing a framework for incorporating water quality monitoring and assessment into water accounting should contribute substantially to the need for more water quality data at global scale. Such data are required to facilitate achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” through more efficient water resources management and greater awareness of water quality impacts in the agricultural water use sector.","Irrigation; Iwrm; Monitoring; Water Accounting; Water Basin; Water Quality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191298869"

Littering of urban waste results in stinking of public spaces, increased dog bite cases, water pollution, air pollution and several vector-borne diseases. Aim & Scope The study aimed to explore impact of urban waste management strategies on public health in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir-India, and analyze the mediating role of AMRUT scheme in augmentation of waste management services and subsequent public health services in the region. Research Methodology & Techniques The paper is based on public survey involving 50 research respondents from general public and key stakeholders, and analysis of data gathered by questionnaire method and secondary data. The primary respondents for the present study included 30 members from general public, 05 senior academicians from university of Kashmir and university of Jammu, 05 eminent journalists and 10 officers from various district administrations. 1-5 Likert scale has been used to analyze primary data and reveal results for the study. Results and Findings he results reveal that mean value for public satisfaction was obtained as (µ-2.0), which reveals that research respondents are least satisfied with the accessibility, affordability and quality of urban waste management and sanitation services in Jammu & Kashmir. The findings also highlight skewed implementation of AMRUT scheme visa vis facilitation of effective waste management strategies, and significant positive correlation between waste management and public health and social wellbeing. Conclusion Availability of optimum waste management, sanitation and public health services, forms core of an urban development plan. Developing countries, like India, need to emphasize adoption of best waste management mechanisms and formulation of area based development strategies. The regions such as Jammu & Kashmir, having world famous tourist destinations and natural landscapes, need to provide optimum global tourism infrastructure and standards of life quality for citizens and visitors. Public health, public safety and public hygiene, must be incorporated as prime objectives of urban development planning, to ensure inclusive and sustainable development.","Amrut; Jammu & Kashmir; Public Health; Waste Management; Well-being; Article; Health Service; Human; India; Jammu And Kashmir; Public Health; Public Health Service; Questionnaire; Sanitation; Social Well-being; Urban Health; Waste Management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191026729"

A multi-stakeholder analysis was performed using the MACTOR method (method of actors and power relations) to analyze stakeholder strategies, alliances, and potential conflicts regarding water management. Data for the study were collected mainly during multi-stakeholder workshops with 6 main stakeholders who are directly involved in managing potable water. A field survey of 329 local households was conducted with the use of supplementary questionnaires. This study proposes that the power dynamics among actors should be considered during the decision-making process to improve collaborative interactions and the effectiveness of stakeholders engaged in water management. The research findings show that the stakeholder’s roles and strategies should be coordinated and strengthened to ensure equitable allocation of water. Technical public agencies deploy management strategies that do not consider water quality as a priority, and they are more concerned with other strategic objectives. Additionally, the stakeholders disagree on many issues relating to water management due to overlapping and conflicting powers, which threatens the quality and availability of water resources. The study also demonstrated that the National Sanitation Office could play an important role as a relay stakeholder and that the Hydrographic Basins Agency should strengthen alliances and commitments with all stakeholders. Enhancing the participation of these stakeholders in water management procedures and empowering domestic water end users, particularly in densely populated residential areas, could help bridge divides and foster a unified approach to achieving sustainable water management objectives.","Mactor Method; Stakeholder Analysis; Water Management; Western Algeria","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188662221"

Several research works have focused on the development and application of suitable materials capable of removing arsenic effectively from water. In this regard, nano-materials have been given considerable importance due to their unique properties. In addition to nano-materials, single, multi and doped metal oxides have also received substantial attention because of their high surface-to-volume ratio, increased magnetic properties, catalytic properties, etc. These metal oxides have been developed using several methods like solid state reaction, vapour deposition, chemical precipitation, etc. among which chemical precipitation is quite user friendly. Single and mixed metal oxides have been applied widely in arsenic removal since they usually have high arsenic adsorption capacity. Several biomaterials including biochar showed promising results in arsenic removal from water. Desorption studies showed that NaOH, KOH were effective in regenerating the adsorbents from the nanomaterials. Graphene based materials usually show very high surface area due to their open structure, thus, they are effective materials in arsenic removal from water. Water treatment using nanomaterials can be one of the sustainable solutions and in synchrony with Goal 6 in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims to ensure availability and sustainable water management and sanitation for the global population.

The water source is carefully selected based on quality, quantity, and reliability. The quality of water at its sources is continuously deteriorating due to various anthropogenic activities and is a major concern to public health as well. The Kalu River is one of the major water resources in Sri Lanka that supplies potable water to the Kalutara district (a highly populated area) and Rathnapura district. But, there has been no significant research or investigation to examine anthropogenic activities in the river. Due to this, it is difficult to find any proper study related to the overall water quality in the Kalu River. Therefore, this study covers a crucial part related to the water quality of the Kalu River. The spatiotemporal variation of river water quality is highly important not only to processing any treatment activities but also to implementing policy decisions. In this context, water quality management is a global concern as countries strive to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Poor water quality can have severe consequences on human health, ecosystems, and economies. Contaminated water sources pose risks of waterborne diseases, reduced agricultural productivity, and ecological imbalances. Hence, assessing and improving water quality is crucial for achieving sustainable development worldwide. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal analysis of the water quality of the Kalu River using the water quality data of eight locations for 6 years from 2017 to 2023. Nine water quality parameters, including the pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, total nitrate, total phosphate, total sulfate, total chlorine, and hardness, were used to develop a simple equation to investigate the water quality index (WQI) of the river. Higher WQI values were not recorded near the famous Kalutara Bridge throughout the years, even though the area is highly urbanized and toured due to religious importance. Overall, the water quality of the river can be considered acceptable based on the results of the WQI. The country lockdowns due to COVID-19 might have impacted the results in 2020; this can be clearly seen with the variation of the annual WQI average, as it clearly indicates decreased levels of the WQI in the years 2020 and 2021, and again, the rise of the WQI level in 2022, as this time period corresponds to the lockdown season and relaxation of the lockdown season in the country. Somehow, for most cases in the Kalu River, the WQI level is well below 25, which can be considered acceptable and suitable for human purposes. But, it may need some attention towards the areas to find possible reasons that are not in the range. Nevertheless, the results suggest the importance of continuous water quality monitoring in the Kalu River.","Anthropogenic Activities; Kalu River; Spatiotemporal Variation; Sri Lanka Standard 614; Water Quality Index (wqi); Covid-19; Drinking Water; Human Activity; Public Health; River Water; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Management; Water Quality; Water Resource; Water Supply; Kalu River; Kalutara; Sri Lanka; Western Province [sri Lanka]","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167918014"

Here, 334 shallow and deep groundwater samples were collected at the end of wet and dry seasons, respectively. Results revealed that elevated and unexpected levels of salinity, hardness, fluoride, nitrate, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon and the alkaline nature of groundwater were the main issues, and the Ca-HCO<inf>3</inf> type was dominant in the groundwater. Water quality index analyses showed that 8.9% and 13.8% of wells had poor quality undrinkable groundwater in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Only 7% of samples were susceptible to sodium and salinity hazards for irrigational use. Reverse osmosis technology with a softening and activated carbon pretreatment process was identified as the most suitable way to treat groundwater with high salinity for many regions of the NCP.

The problem in this study is to determine community participation in its contribution to achieving SDGs (6) goals in the use of public toilet facilities built from local government budgets in a sustainable effort in the SANIMAS program in Bandung City West Java. The research results that have been carried out show that the use of shared toilet facilities requires participation from the community and the increasing number of residents in each urban area. Policies from the government can anticipate problems in the future, and there is a need for collaboration between the government, the private sector, and the community by paying attention to the environment both for the sustainability of water reserves from dug wells and the use of technology that can prevent river water pollution in the city, as well as the sustainability of the sanitation program for all public.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149915103"

This problem shows us that every parameter in the sustainability index is equal, while in real life there is no equal parameter. In this paper a weightage for each parameter is proposed to enhance the sustainability index. The method to assess the sustainability index parameters was using a questionnaire by key experts in the water industry. Using ANFIS computational intelligence, the result of the assessment was then fit to the frequent parameters that exist in other sustainability indexes. This proposed method can produce a ranking and weight for each sustainability index parameter and criteria. Using this method, the weightage for each sustainability index parameter can be generated, such as environmental 0.301, engineering 0.214, economic 0.280, and social 0.205.","Anfis; Computational Intelligence; Sustainability Index; Water Industry; Weightage","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164986912"

Constraints on crop production in humid regions are primarily radiation, temperature, nutrition, sanitation, erosion, and waterlogging. Soil and water conservation managements are especially important to low-input dryland agriculture with 200-to 500-mm precipitation. Crop rotation benefits that maintain high productivity and conserve soil and water resources have long been recognized. Soil and water conservation practices are crucial for long-term sustainable agriculture. To ensure that these practices are implemented, there must be positive cooperation and interaction between research, regional planning, extension service, and government legislation.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0343821602"

As a result, the groundwater in this zone has serious chemical quality problems. To qualify and predict groundwater quality of this region, which may later facilitate its management, two machine learning models (Naïve-Bayes and Decision-tree) are proposed. These models did not require great computing power and were developed from a reduced number of data using the KNIME (KoNstanz Information MinEr) tool. Their accuracy was tested by the corresponding confusion matrix, providing a high accuracy in both models. The obtained results showed that groundwater quality was higher in the northern and west zones. This may be due to the presence in the north of the Andalusian aquifer, the deepest in Campo de Cartagena, and in the west to the predominance of rainfed crops, where the amount of water available for leaching fertilizers is lower, coming mainly from rainfall.","Agricultural Activity; Decision-tree; Groundwater Contamination; Machine Learning; Naïve-bayes; Nitrate","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144909686"

Safe drinking water and sanitation are essential, especially for children, to prevent acute and chronic illness death and sustain a healthy life. The UN General Assembly announced the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets for the 2030 Agenda on 25 September 2015. SDG 6 is very important because it affects other SDG (1, 2,3,5,11,14 and 15). The present study deals with the national and state-wise analysis of the current status and to access deficiency of India's achievement towards SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation for all) for the 2030 agenda based on targets 6.1, 6.2,6.4,6.6 from 2012 to 2020. Materials and methods: Data of different indicators of SDG 6 are collected from different secondary sources—NSS 69th (2012) and 76th (2018) round; CGWB annual report 2016–2017 and 2018-2019; NARSS (2019–2020); SBM-Grameen (2020). To understand overall achievement towards SDG 6 in the 2030 agenda, the goal score (arithmetic mean of normalised value) has been calculated. Major findings: According to NSS data, 88.7% of Indian households had enough drinking water from primary drinking water sources throughout the year, while 79.8% of households had access to toilet facilities in 2018. As per the 2019–2021 goal score for States and UTs in rural India based on SDG 6 indicator, SDG 6 achiever States and UTs (100%) are Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Conclusion: Drinking water and sanitation for all ensure a healthy life. It is a matter of concern for the government, policymakers, and people to improve the condition where the goal score and indicator value of SDG 6 are low.","Clean Water And Sanitation; Public Health; Sdg 6; Sustainable Development; Universal Coverage Of Latrine And Sanitation; Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Child; Family Size; Human; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Water Supply; Child; Drinking Water; Family Characteristics; Humans; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Water Supply","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142469326"

This challenging goal requires innovations, especially in areas with freshwater scarcity. Coupling this with the expected significant growth in population, especially in developing countries, presents major challenges to obtaining the appropriate levels of water provision needed. The development of seawater desalination technologies offers hope to alleviate freshwater shortages whilst supporting SDG 6. This research addresses the development of small-scale technology utilizing solar energy for providing clean drinking water in rural, hot, arid, and remote communities. To alleviate water scarcity in rural and isolated areas, a micro solar still (MSS) system that supports a multistage distillation process can be utilized, which evaporates and condenses the saline feed water into pure drinking water with highly efficient solar heat collectors. The focus of this study was to assess the performance of two prototypes, with minor improvements to the wicking structure. Such a system has the advantage of recycling wasted latent heat in the process to increase productivity. Two prototypes were tested to assess the performance of the solar still construction material and yield, and to test the water quality and quantity under the climatic conditions of Kuwait. The operation and efficiency of the prototypes were observed across four characteristics: solar irradiance, ambient temperatures, feed water and water production. The performances of the two prototypes were comparable to the results of previously published work on MSS prototypes that utilize wicking. The recovery rates of the two prototypes were 22 and 25%, respectively. The maximum production of potable water achieved from the two prototypes was 900 and 1160 g, respectively, using a feed of 4 and 3.7 kgs. The quality of the produced water met the WHO’s standards for drinking water.","Desalination; Latent Heat; Micro Solar Still; Solar Energy; Desalination; Developing Countries; Distillation; Evaporation; Irrigation; Latent Heat; Passive Solar; Population Statistics; Rural Areas; Saline Water; Satellites; Solar Heating; Sustainable Development; Water Quality; Availability Management; Feed Water; Global Issues; Micro Solar Still; Performance; Pilot Studies; Solar Stills; Sustainable Management; United Nations; Water Scarcity; Potable Water","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142726057"

The unique features of the region, namely the scarcity of rainfall, the high concentration of arsenic in freshwaters and the increasing pressure of the mining sector, have made the supply of drinking water for local communities a challenge. In the 1950s, the town of Antofagasta experienced a serious drinking water crisis. The 300 km long aqueduct starting from the Toconce catchment, opened in 1958, temporarily ended this shortage of drinking water but created an even more dramatic problem. The concentration of arsenic in the water consumed by the population had grown by approx. ten times, reaching the value of 0.860 mg/L and seriously affecting people’s health. The water treatment plants (WTPs) which were installed starting from the 1970s in the region (namely the Old and New Salar del Carmen in Antofagasta and Cerro Topater in Calama, plus the two recent desalination plants in Antofagasta and Tocopilla), have ensured, since 2014, that the drinking water coverage in the urban areas was practically universal (>99.9%). However, the rural areas have continued to experience significant shortcomings regarding their capacity to ensure the quality and continuity of the water supply service in the long run. Presently, approx. 42% of the rural population of the region of Antofagasta does not have a formal supply of drinking water. The recent amendments to the Chilean Water Code (March 2022) and the interventions carried out in the framework of the Agua Potable Rural (APR) program were intended to reduce the socio-ecological inequalities due to the lack of drinking water in the semi-concentrated and isolated rural population.","Agua Potable Rural Program; Arsenic Contamination; Chilean Water Code; Climate Change; Environmental Sanitary Engineering; Mining; Sdg6: Clean Water And Sanitation; Water Scarcity; Water Treatment Plant; Arsenic; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Climate Change; Concentration (composition); Desalination; Mining; Rural Area; Sanitation; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Pollution; Water Supply; Water Treatment Plant; Chile; Economic Development; Environmental Management; Geography; Health Program; History; Human; Hydrology; Review; Urban Area; Waste Component Removal; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Water Availability; Epidemiology; Rural Population; Antofagasta; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Humans; Rural Population; Water Supply","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141638367"

To ensure a secure water supply, water-reuse concepts and its implementation are gaining more and more importance. Additionally, water saving potentials to optimize the drinking and water reuse availability have to be considered. However, limited spatial planning opportunities and missing regulation to provide treated wastewater according to the “fit-for-purpose” principle are often hindering its application. Some countries, such as the USA or Singapore, have been leading the way for decades in implementing water-reuse concepts and in treating wastewater for potable and non-potable reuse. The wastewater treatment technologies are currently providing solutions for an adequate provision of reclaimed water. Consequently, the opportunities for water reuse are given, but the challenge is largely in the implementation, which becomes necessary in water-scarce regions.

Hydrological models have been confirmed in recent decades as one of the effective measures used for studies on water resources to support decision-making, because of its importance and the accuracy of its results in simulating reality and the future. This study therefore relied on the latest water-resource management software, Watershed Modeling System (WMS), which con-tains the HEC-1 model for the construction of a hydrological flow model for basin modeling. The study area extends between Port Sudan (Sudan) and Ras Bennas (Egypt), where the region is of great importance as it can be a future tourist city to attract beach tourism from all countries of the world. These areas need to be protected from the dangers of torrents and to preserve these historical features for us and for future generations. This study provides an attempt to identify and maintain existing and future development areas from the dangers of torrential torrents and establish standards for ways to protect them from such hazards according to a variety of different foundations and standards. The study used modern GIS and remote sensing technology to collect and analyze geographic data to achieve the best scientific results to address the risks of torrents to the region. The study has examined geological features and morphometrie drainage systems to assess the region’s geomorpholog-ical hazards and propose ways to cope with them such as dams to reach development possibilities (agricultural, urban, and tourist) after the protection work has been completed. he research made it feasible to introduce modern remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to study the effects of the best location for the planned dams to be chosen and to assess the quantities of water needed to be stored in existing wadi dams in the study region. A prediction map was produced using hydraulic modeling to identify the best places to choose the dam positions and storage areas of dams in front of it. Proposed dams help develop the coastline from Port Sudan to the city of Berenice. By sustainable water management preparation, efficient management of flash floods for their use for agricultural purposes can be achieved. Flood water harvesting benefits can be considered to be twofold, i.e. to save flood losses and provide reservoir storage facilities. The harvest of the torrential water can be used by making stone and concrete dams. The dams will be used to reserve the running surface water in the valleys in separate freshwater lakes. These can be constructed on the wadis outlet, and from which approximately 10 billion m3 of water can be stored in the event of an 86.8 mm rainfall within a day.","Berenice; Gis; Hydrological Properties; Modelling; Port Sudan; Remote Sensing; Torrential Hazards; Water Harvest; Wms","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208181035"

In understanding societal challenges involving adequate nutrition and abolishment of hunger and disease, linkages are being sought between a research agenda and sustainable development that promote the cooperation of communities. The small-scale livestock producers have struggled with sustaining their productivity amidst food-borne neglected tropical diseases, poor husbandry systems, and modernization of traditional ways of rearing their livestock on one hand, and on the other, ensuring a sustainable livelihood and feeding people. While widespread traditional pig production continues to be the hallmark of resiliency in providing livelihoods of the rural population, existing production challenges require an improvement in ways of raising indigenous pigs in averting hunger, and where applicable, taking advantage of IK and associated methodologies. Efforts aimed at replacing indigenous breeds with unsuitable exotic breeds or crossbreeding have had mixed results as the farmers and their communities believe their indigenous ways still have a place in the sustainability of the enterprises. Striking a balance between the adoption of modernized animal livestock practices and its potential for increased productivity and disease control strategies, and taking into consideration experiences, and practices that, if desirable to fight hunger, can encourage communities to take research outcomes seriously. Such adoptions may lead to sustainable initiatives that are locally driven. While the fight against hunger may be the focus of SDG #2, the SDGs will remain integrated in terms of neglected tropical diseases. This is because any action done to achieve any of them, particularly SDG 1 “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” and SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” affects outcomes in others. To achieve any meaningful progress, any development must balance aspects of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Considering the wealth of IK and the pursuit of the social value of research, approaches are being modified to improve a community-based inquiry and application.","Indigenous Knowledge; Intangible Cultural Heritage; One Health; Sustainable Development Goals; Taenia Solium","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140759785"

The objectives of this short communication were 1) to assess the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs in seven provinces in Afghanistan before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) to elucidate the relevance of these patterns with the number of reported HCW infections from COVID-19 in the mentioned provinces. Methods: We analyzed secondary data from the 2018-19 Afghanistan Service Provision Assessment survey, which included 142 public and private HCFs in seven major provinces in Afghanistan. Data on COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health Data Warehouse. Weighted prevalence of WASH services and standard precautions were calculated using frequencies and percentages. ArcGIS maps were used to visualize the distribution of COVID-19 cases, and scatter plots were created to visualize the relevance of WASH services and standard precautions to COVID-19 cases in provinces. Results: Of the 142 facilities surveyed, about 97% had improved water sources, and over 94% had improved toilet for clients. Overall, HCFs had limited availability of hygiene services and standard precautions, which was lower in private than public facilities. More than half of the facilities had safe final disposal and appropriate storage of sharps and medical waste. Of the seven provinces, Herat province had the highest cumulative COVID-19 case rate among HCWs per 100,000 population and reported lower availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs compared to other provinces. Conclusion: Our findings show disparities in the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in public and private facilities. Private facilities had a lower availability of hygiene services and standard precautions than public facilities. Provinces with higher availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs had a lower cumulative COVID-19 case rate among HCWs per 100,000 population. Pre-pandemic preparation of adequate WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs could be potentially important in combating infectious disease emergence.","Covid-19; Hygiene; Sanitation; Standard Precautions; Water; Alcohol; Water; Water; Alcohol; Disinfectant Agent; Hand Sanitizer; Soap; Water; Afghanistan; Article; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Data Warehouse; Hand Washing; Health Care Facility; Health Care Personnel; Hospital Hygiene; Hospital Waste; Human; Prevalence; Private Hospital; Public Hospital; Sanitation; Waste Disposal; Waste Management; Water Supply; Epidemiology; Health Care Delivery; Hygiene; Pandemic; Prevention And Control; Covid-19; Delivery Of Health Care; Humans; Hygiene; Pandemics; Sanitation; Water; Water Supply","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126618558"

It has made significant contributions to the gross state value added through agriculture and allied sectors, and water management is the most vital component to ensure stability and sustainability in agricultural production systems. There is increasing uncertainty in availability, or site-specific excess of water due to climate change. These call for strategic management of this important natural resource to achieve one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG No. 6) set by the United Nations, i.e. ensuring availability and sustainability in water management, and also providing sanitation to all by 2030. This eastern Indian state has six distinct agro-climatic zones (ACZs) based on its varied physiography, land, soil, weather, cropping pattern, vegetation and other characteristic features. Both water scarcity and water excess are intricately associated with the agricultural activities in the state, which demand integrated approach in the management of water resources and their efficient utilization. Here we elucidate the agricultural importance, distinctive features and constraints of six ACZs, provide an account of the water supply and demand, potential options to increase water-use efficiency, suitable technologies and zone-wise policy perspectives on water management in agriculture and allied sectors in West Bengal.","Agricultural Technology; Agro-climatic Zones; Policy; Water Management; Water-use Efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125534551"

Brazil is one of these cases, given, for example, the existing asymmetries in the access to water supply and sanitation service networks. For this reason, we propose a benchmarking exercise using a two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis to measure the technical and scale efficiency of the Brazilian municipalities’ WSSs, noting their contextual environment. Our results point towards low mean efficiency scores, motivated by the existence of significant scale inefficiencies (the vast majority of municipalities are operating at a larger than optimal scale). Furthermore, the Water source was found to be a statistically significant efficiency predictor, with statistically significant differences found in terms of Ownership and Geography. Ultimately, we suggest policy-making and regulatory possibilities based on debureaucratization, the implementation of stricter expenditure control policies, and investment in the expansion of WSSs.","Brazil; Contextual Environment; Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency Measurement; Water And Sanitation Services; Data Envelopment Analysis; Drinking Water; Efficiency Measurement; Policy Making; Sanitation; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Management; Water Supply; Brazil","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121765573"

Goal 6 of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognizes this importance and aims to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” Despite progress, the UN reports billions of people still lack water and sanitation services. Many governments around the world face the challenge of balancing between investment in new assets, programs, and services and providing the required funding for repair and replacement of existing water assets. This paper argues infrastructure asset management establishes a foundational framework for the system of operations, management, and importantly, governance of assets to deliver services. An enabling environment for asset management, in addition to supporting the delivery of services, also contributes to meeting public policy objectives. The research question is: How can governments utilize public policy to enable asset management and consequently achieve societal objectives. A variety of public policy instruments used to enable infrastructure asset management and support achievement of government goals and objectives, such as the UN SDGs, are outlined and analyzed. The methodology involved a survey and case studies drawn from three countries, focused on the water sector. It also presents outcomes, common elements, and the need for and benefits of standardization.","Asset Management; Public Policy; Standards; Water Services; Asset Management; Environmental Management; Investments; Sanitation; Standardization; Sustainable Development; Water Management; Water Supply; Assets Management; Availability Management; Human Health; Infrastructure Asset Management; Stormwaters; United Nations; Urban Water Supply; Water Sector; Water Service; Well Being; Public Policy; Assessment Method; Governance Approach; Government; Maximum Sustainable Yield; Social Planning, Policy And Management; Social Policy; Standard (regulation); Sustainability; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment; Water Industry; Water Management; Water Supply","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120991003"

However, the current global pandemic further emphasised the importance of WSS, given the increasing asymmetries faced by billions worldwide, and the gaps between high-income and low- and middle-income nations. For this reason, understanding whether low- and middle-income countries have been approximating towards or deviating from the SDG 6 is crucial to derive and communicate key information for the sake of improved public governance and political decision-making. In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art methodology based on data envelopment analysis for assessing the convergence of the low- and middle-income UN Member States regarding the SDG 6 between 2016 and 2017. We find that, on average, not only did the Member States converge by decreasing the performance spread and the gap between the best and worst practice frontiers, but also the Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources was the indicator in which the majority exhibited the worst performances. In the end, we derive possible policy implications, which, as our results show, are aligned with the recent UN reports on the subject.","Convergence; Data Envelopment Analysis; Governance; Sustainable Development; Water And Sanitation Services; Data Envelopment Analysis; Decision Making; Planning; Public Policy; Sanitation; Water Conservation; Water Management; Convergence; Governance; Low Incomes; Middle Incomes; Performance; Sanitation Services; Sustainable Water; United Nations; Water Service; World Population; Sustainable Development; Fresh Water; Decision Making; Millenium Development Goal; Policy Approach; Sanitation; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Resource; Article; Environmental Sanitation; Middle Income Country; Water Stress; Global Health; Indicator Indicator; Global Health; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117903448"

One of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all with specific emphasis on data and good governance. Therefore, this study was conducted in the Kuiseb Basin, Namibia to assess the physical and chemical quality of groundwater, chemical water type and chemical characteristics of sediment to determine its suitability for human consumption. Water and sediments samples from 20 sampling sites (boreholes) were analysed for physical and chemical characteristics and the following mean values were obtained for temperature (26.66 °C), electrical conductivity (396.85 mS/m), pH (7.26), total dissolved solid (494.45 mg/L) and dissolved oxygen (7.46 mg/L). Physico-chemical results suggest that the Kuiseb Basin is predominantly a calcium bicarbonate water type (Ca (HCO3)2) and most of the physico-chemical parameters tested fell within the permissible limits for drinking water set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Analysis of the major ion chemistry (Mg2+ > + Ca2+ > + Na+ > + K+ and HCO3− > CO3− > SO4 2− > Cl−) indicated the dominance of rock-water interaction and the influence of anthropogenic activities as the main processes controlling groundwater chemistry in the area. It is recommended that the Basin, as a heavily used and sensitive environment, requires basin-wide river management.","Anthropogenic; Geochemical Assessment; Groundwater; Hydrochemistry; Kuiseb River Basin; Water Quality; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Calcium Compounds; Dissolved Oxygen; Groundwater; Groundwater Resources; Potable Water; Sustainable Development; Water Management; Anthropogenic Activity; Chemical Characteristic; Electrical Conductivity; Geochemical Assessments; Physical And Chemical Characteristics; Physico - Chemical Parameters; Rock Water Interaction; Sustainable Management; Hydrochemistry; Anthropogenic Effect; Groundwater; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Chemistry; Water Management; Water Quality; Water Use; Kuiseb River; Namibia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097468511"

Community participation and the co-production of knowledge in the development of innovative technologies, which are aligned with Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) principles, can lead to more sustainable and socially-acceptable hand hygiene systems. This paper presents the outcomes of the testing of the Autarky handwashing station, a technology that provides onsite treatment and recycling of handwashing water, in an informal settlement in Durban, South Africa. The transdisciplinary research approach adopted enabled the participation of multiple stakeholders with different knowledge systems in the framing, testing and evaluation of the system. The process of co-producing knowledge, as well as the outcomes of the testing, namely high levels of functionality and social acceptability of the technology, supported the WASH principles. The evaluation revealed that the Autarky handwashing station is a niche intervention that improved access to safe and appealing handwashing facilities in an informal settlement. Its novel design, socially desirable features, reliability and ability to save water increased its acceptance in the community. The testing of the system in a real-world context revealed the value of including communities in knowledge production processes for technology innovation.

Clean water and adequate sanitation are the sixth goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and targets include to ensure the availability of clean water and sustainable sanitation for all by 2030. The achievement of targets in water supply and sanitation in Indonesia is still lagging behind other fields. There are differences in the ease of obtaining access to clean water sources in urban and rural areas, especially for rural communities living on peatlands who experience issues in being provided with clean water. The difficulty is that, even though the amount of available water is relatively large, its quality is low. Barriers to the equitable distribution of services by the government to the entire community are caused by the limited availability of funding, the geographical conditions of scattered settlements, and the limited capacity of human resources. As a result of this problem, it is necessary to formulate a management strategy for providing access to clean water and sanitation for rural communities on peatlands. This research uses the case-study method. The management strategy was formulated on the basis of the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the community. This method was used to test the effectiveness of the formulated strategy in realizing water security on peatlands in the village of Wajok Hilir. The resulting management strategy can be applied to other villages that have the same land characteristics. The strategy to realize water security for rural communities on peatlands is a self-service strategy. The implementation of the self-service strategy needs to be supported by infrastructure in the form of peat water treatment plant buildings, wells drilled to aquifer depths, and canal blocking to control the groundwater level in peatlands. The management strategy is carried out with community participation, considering that peatlands are a potential water source to meet clean water needs and achieve sustainable water security targets. Efforts to implement the self-service strategy are carried out with these methods: (1) socialization carried out in an integrated manner, (2) infrastructure development as a pilot project, (3) providing knowledge about infrastructure operations, (4) providing temporary assistance to the community, and (5) providing material supplies so that rural communities that are partners can become pioneers of similar movements.","Peat Water; Peatlands; Rural; Sdg 6; Water Management Strategy; Water Security; Aquifers; Groundwater Resources; Infrastructure As A Service (iaas); Planning; Project Management; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Tropics; Water Conservation; Water Supply; Water Treatment; Wetlands; Case Study Methods; Community Participation; Geographical Conditions; Infrastructure Development; Management Strategies; Socio-economic Conditions; Sustainable Water; Urban And Rural Areas; Rural Areas; Peatland; Social Participation; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Strategic Approach; Tropical Environment; Water Management; Water Relations; Water Resource; Indonesia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114741407"

To ensure consistency in the existence of drinking water, it is inevitable to establish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). 70% of India's rural population was found to be without WWTP, waste disposal, and good sanitation. Wastewater has emerged from kitchens, washrooms, etc., with industry activities. This scenario caused severe damage to water resources, leading to degradation of water quality and pathogenic insects. Thus, it is a need of an hour to prompt for better WWTPs for both rural and urban areas. Many parts of the world have started to face severe water shortages in recent years, and wastewater reuse methods need to be updated. Clean water supply is not enough to satisfy the needs of the planet as a whole, and the majority of freshwater in the polar regions takes the form of ice and snow. The increasing population requires clean water for drinks, hygiene, irrigation, and various other applications. Lack of water and contamination of water result from human activities. 90% of wastewater is released to water systems without treatment in developing countries. Studies show that about 730 megatons of waste are annually discharged into water from sewages and other effluents. The sustenance of water resources, applying wastewater treatment technologies, and calling down the percentage of potable water has to be strictly guided by mankind. This review compares the treatment of domestic sewage to its working conditions, energy efficiency, etc. In this review, several treatment methods with different mechanisms involved in waste treatment, industrial effluents, recovery/recycling were discussed. The feasibility of bioaugmentation should eventually be tested through data from field implementation as an important technological challenge, and this analysis identifies many promising areas to be explored in the future.","Anthropogenic; Microbial Population; Sanitation Facilities; Sustainable Development; Wastewater; Waste Water; Beverages; Developing Countries; Effluents; Energy Efficiency; Industrial Waste Treatment; Population Statistics; Rural Areas; Sewage; Sewage Treatment Plants; Wastewater Disposal; Wastewater Reclamation; Wastewater Treatment; Water Conservation; Water Quality; Water Supply; Water Treatment; Anthropogenic Activity; Different Mechanisms; Field Implementation; Industrial Effluent; Technological Challenges; Wastewater Management; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Wastewater Treatment Technologies; Potable Water; Drinking Water; Industrial Effluent; Bioaugmentation; Feasibility Study; Human Activity; Microbial Community; Sanitation; Sewage; Sustainable Development; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality; Article; Bacteriophage; Bacterium; Bioremediation; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Diseases; Domestic Waste; Energy Recovery; Environmental Sustainability; Filtration; Green Chemistry; Infectious Agent; Microbial Metabolism; Nonhuman; Phytoremediation; Pollutant; Prediction; Rural Area; Urban Area; Vermicompost; Virus; Waste Disposal; Waste Water Management; Waste Water Recycling; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Wastewater; Worm; Human; Water Management; Water Supply; India; Hexapoda; Humans; Sanitation; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Purification; Water Supply","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100613671"

The expected growth of the world’s population, from about 7.8 billion people today to 9.8 billion people by 2050, and to around 11 billion people by the end of 2100, will create even higher demand and a greater strain on these basic services. Goal 6 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’ by 2030. However, in a recent report, UN-Water warns us that if things continue on the current path, the world will miss the targets of SDG 6. The selection of appropriate water and sanitation technologies is key to meeting SDG 6 targets. This paper presents an original framework of a decision support system (DSS) for the selection of appropriate water supply and sanitation (Watsan) technologies in developing countries. The proposed DSS has three components. The first component is the user interface, where the inputs are the assessment of a community’s capacity to manage a given water supply or sanitation system, and its regional specificity. The second component of the DSS is a database of Watsan technologies classified according to the capacity requirement level (CRL) metric, and finally, the third component is a matching algorithm for the selection of appropriate Watsan technology options. Case studies and simulations results are presented for the evaluation of the performance of the decision support system.","Community Capacity Assessment; Decision Support System; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Infrastructure; Water And Sanitation Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Support Systems; Developing Countries; Planning; Population Statistics; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; User Interfaces; Water Management; Capacity Assessment; Community Capacity Assessment; High Demand; Sanitation Services; Sanitation Systems; Sustainable Development Goal; Sustainable Infrastructure; United Nations; Water Supply Services; Water System; Water Supply; Decision Support System; Developing World; Sanitation; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Supply","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119982953"

In the context of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets on health (Goal 3), water quality (Goal 6), life under water (Goal 14), and clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), which aim to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”, we investigated the environmental reservoirs of V. cholerae in Vembanad Lake, the largest lake in Kerala (India), where cholera is endemic. The response of environmental reservoirs of V. cholerae to variability in essential climate variables may play a pivotal role in determining the quality of natural water resources, and whether they might be safe for human consumption or not. The hydrodynamics of Vembanad Lake, and the man-made barrier that divides the lake, resulted in spatial and temporal variability in salinity (1–32 psu) and temperature (23 to 36◦C). The higher ends of this salinity and temperature ranges fall outside the preferred growth conditions for V. cholerae reported in the literature. The bacteria were associated with filtered water as well as with phyto-and zooplankton in the lake. Their association with benthic organisms and sediments was poor to nil. The prevalence of high laminarinase and chitinase enzyme expression (more than 50 µgmL−1 min−1) among V. cholerae could underlie their high association with phyto-and zooplankton. Furthermore, the diversity in the phytoplankton community in the lake, with dominance of genera such as Skeletonema sp., Microcystis sp., Aulacoseira sp., and Anabaena sp., which changed with location and season, and associated changes in the zooplankton community, could also have affected the dynamics of the bacteria in the lake. The probability of presence or absence of V. cholerae could be expressed as a function of chlorophyll concentration in the water, which suggests that risk maps for the entire lake can be generated using satellite-derived chlorophyll data. In situ observations and satellite-based extrapolations suggest that the risks from environmental V. cholerae in the lake can be quite high (with probability in the range of 0.5 to 1) everywhere in the lake, but higher values are encountered more frequently in the southern part of the lake. Remote sensing has an important role to play in meeting SDG goals related to health, water quality and life under water, as demonstrated in this example related to cholera.","Chitinase; Chlorophyll; Cholera; Laminarinase; Plankton; Bacteria; Chlorophyll; Diseases; Lakes; Maps; Plankton; Remote Sensing; Reservoir Management; Risks; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Tropics; Water Management; Water Quality; Chlorophyll Concentration; Environmental Reservoirs; In-situ Observations; Natural Water Resources; Phytoplankton Community; Spatial And Temporal Variability; Sustainable Management; Zooplankton Communities; Reservoirs (water)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102972665"

Such practices include, but are not limited to, dumping of municipal refuse and wastewater in water bodies, open defecation, open grazing, and unchecked oil pollution. The ecological human health risks are extremely high and the burden enormous. There is an urgent need for re-evaluation of Nigeria water policies, revamping of water agencies and infrastructure, and adequate funding of water-related collaborative research.

A web-based platform called Supporting Water Resources Management (SWARM) was developed to enable users with differing knowledge bases to collaboratively explore the consequences of future management strategies and climate uncertainties on water resource availability and sectoral allocation plans to aid decision-making. The SWARM platform currently consists of four Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model-based catchment case studies within the Lower Mekong Region representing the Huai Sai Bat, Chindwin, Srepok, and Ca basins.

The results show that the main challenges faced by most local authorities are: the mobilization of financial resources, the inadequacy of own income, unreliability of central government transfers and weakness of financial management, economic uncertainty, the difficulty of balancing the reality of the local budget with reduced revenues, the widening gap between the availability of financial resources and municipal expenditure needs. Responsibility and financial resource management are the basis for the good governance of local governments, key drivers for public institutions on the improvement path and ensure sustainable development. To successfully implement sustainable development, for ensuring the financial resilience of local authorities it becomes crucial to develop a strategic financial management plan. Financial management can be a tool for improving the performance of local government. Only with effective local government, with financial resilience and sound public financial management, with the active engagement of local government and citizens, it will be possible to achieve the success of sustainable development including ending poverty in all its forms, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels are the mission of local government.","Financial Management; Financial Resilience; Fiscal Decentralization; Local Authorities; Local Budget; Local Government","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113176034"

Design research that is sensitive to humanitarian context can bridge this gap by systematically involving affected people in the design of the aid they receive. The User-Centred Community Engagement methodology described in this chapter makes use of design research as part of a user-centred approach to inform the design of sanitation facilities in humanitarian crises. In this chapter, the members of Eclipse Experience outline how they developed the methodology with their humanitarian partners, piloted it in crisis contexts and achieved proof of concept. They further share the first steps on their journey to scale with the development and testing of an open-source digital toolkit.

We present an ongoing experience in the Coros region, a low-density area in North-Western Sardinia with a strong agricultural vocation. The ecological approach finds its operability in the connectivity potential of the green infrastructure as a project of the system of connections among ecosystem services at different levels. The green infrastructure includes green and blue areas (vineyards, olive groves and artichoke fields, the water ecosystems of the Riu Mannu, the Mascari river, the Cuga and Bidighinzu lakes, and several basins). Finally, the connection strategy finds support in the reorganization of the grey infrastructure, in order to connect and manage the pipeline network for the transportation of the wastewater purified with refinement processes, useful for the agricultural supply function.","Agricultural Landscape; Basin Contract; Ecosystem Services; Green And Blue Infrastructure; System Of Connections; Wastewater Reuse; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Employment; Environmental Regulations; Hydrogeology; Infrastructure As A Service (iaas); Planning; Regional Planning; Sustainable Development; Water Management; Cultural Landscape; Ecological Approaches; Ecosystem Services; Green Infrastructure; Integrated Management; Pipeline Networks; Refinement Process; Sustainable Management; Ecosystems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108907384"

This exposure route remains a major cause of infection and mortality in developing countries, particularly rural regions. To meet the UN's sustainable development goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, we need to identify the key controls on faecal contamination across relevant settings. We conducted a high-resolution spatial study of E. coli concentration in catchment drainage waters over 6 months in a mixed land-use catchment in the extensive karst region extending across impoverished southwest China. Using a mixed effects modelling framework, we tested how land-use, karst hydrology, antecedent meteorological conditions, agricultural cycles, hydrochemistry, and position in the catchment system affected E. coli concentrations. Land-use was the best predictor of faecal contamination levels. Sites in urban areas were chronically highly contaminated, but water draining from agricultural land was also consistently contaminated and there was a catchment wide pulse of higher E. coli concentrations, turbidity, and discharge during paddy field drainage. E. coli concentration increased with increasing antecedent rainfall across all land-use types and compartments of the karst hydrological system (underground and surface waters), but decreased with increasing pH. This is interpreted to be a result of processes affecting pH, such as water residence time, rather than the direct effect of pH on E. coli survival. Improved containment and treatment of human waste in areas of higher population density would likely reduce contamination hotspots, and further research is needed to identify the nature and distribution of sources in agricultural land.","Drinking Water Quality; Faecal Contamination; Karst Water Resources; Mixed-effects Modelling; Rural Developing Regions; Spatiotemporal Controls; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Catchments; Contamination; Developing Countries; Escherichia Coli; Groundwater; Groundwater Geochemistry; Groundwater Pollution; Hydrogeology; Land Use; Landforms; Population Statistics; Residence Time Distribution; River Pollution; Runoff; Sustainable Development; Urban Growth; Waste Treatment; Water Management; Agricultural Drainage; Antecedent Rainfall; Faecal Contamination; Karst Water Resources; Meteorological Condition; Population Densities; Sustainable Management; Water Residence Time; Rural Areas; Ground Water; Rain; Surface Water; Coliform Bacterium; Concentration (composition); Drainage Network; Karst Hydrology; Land Use Change; Paddy Field; Rural Area; Spatial Analysis; Agricultural Land; Agriculture; Article; Bacterial Survival; Catchment Area (hydrology); China; Controlled Study; Land Use; Microbial Contamination; Nonhuman; Ph; Prediction; Priority Journal; Turbidity; Urban Area; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Water Residence Time; Water Supply; Animal; Environmental Monitoring; Human; Hydrology; Animalia; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrology; Water Pollution; Water Resources","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088656529"

Over half the world’s population in the middle- and low-income countries will not have sanitation and water with sufficient quality and quantity due to limited financial and freshwater resources. An algal-based wastewater treatment (A-WWT) system is proposed here as an appropriate and affordable pathway to support SDG 6 as well as 11 other related SDGs. Our previous reports on this A-WWT system have documented its ability to produce discharge-ready water, comparable in quality to that of the conventional activated sludge-based (CAS) system, but at lower initial cost and lower energy needs. In the current study, we demonstrate that activated carbon adsorption and ozonation are potential follow-up processes to reclaim high-quality water for beneficial reuse. The quality of water reclaimed by the A-WWT system is shown to be superior to what is currently possible with the CAS system. Microbial assessments and Microtox toxicity assays confirm that the reclaimed water from the A-WWT system is safe for agricultural reuse. The A-WWT system holds promise as a greener alternative to meet the four targets under SDG 6: improving water quality, wastewater treatment, and safe reuse; increasing water-use efficiency and ensuring freshwater supplies; implementing water reuse management; and protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems.","Algal Wastewater Treatment; Appropriate Technologies; Reclaimed Water; Reclaimed Water Quality; Sustainable Development Goals; Activated Carbon; Adsorption; Ozonation; Sanitation; Sludge; Sustainable Development; United Nations; Wastewater Treatment; Water Resource; Water Use Efficiency; Algae","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084461690"

It is comprised of 17 holistic, indivisible, and universally applicable goals that embed and integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development – the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. These goals are supported by 169 integrated targets and 232 global indicators to enable global monitoring and reporting on their implementation progress. Goal 6 (SDG 6) of this agenda – the water and sanitation goal – aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. As opposed to goal 7 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which was limited to access to water and sanitation facilities, SDG 6 of the sustainable development goals covers the entire water – cycle in an integrated manner. It is extended to address drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, protection of water-related ecosystems, water use efficiency and scarcity, and water management at both national and trans-boundary levels. Water and sanitation services are at the very core of the 2030 Agenda; thereby SDG 6 is cutting across all the other goals on both targets and indicator levels. This paper attempts to establish a baseline and methodological mechanism for monitoring and reporting on SDG 6 in the Kingdom of Bahrain. A trend analysis approach was used for tracking progress towards meeting the SDG 6 targets. According to the monitoring results, progress varies considerably. Bahrain has fully achieved the targets of increasing the coverage of the population having access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, and halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, well ahead of the agenda deadline. Progress on attaining the targets associated with the protection of water-related ecosystems and water use efficiency and water scarcity are, however, falling short at various degrees of implementation. The monitoring efforts also reveal that, despite the modest progress made on enhancing the institutional structures and capacity building in the water sector, implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) is still facing enormous challenges. In general, our analyses have shown that the natural water scarcity, high population growth rates, accel-erated socio-economic development, non-efficient water use, shortages in financial outlays, and the lack of adequate technical and institutional capacities are the crucial factors hindering or decelerating progress on achieving SDG 6. Although sufficient data were made available for our analysis, data gaps were inevitable and require focused attention during the 2030 Agenda time frame. Among oth-ers, a set of potential management measures and policy interventions that may help fill these gaps and accelerate progress are recommended.","Kingdom Of Bahrain; Sdg 6; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Water Management; Water And Sanitation; Pollutant Removal; Sanitation; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Supply; Water Treatment; Bahrain; Indicator Indicator","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098769220"

To align with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 6: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”, the government spending on wastewater services dramatically increased over the past two decades aiming to extend sanitation services all over Oman. However, the expansion of the wastewater infrastructure will have to address the conditions of rural and suburban settlements in order to reduce network and pumping requirements and the risk of technical failure to the minimum and to ensure cost efficiency. To achieve this goal, a pilot project has been set up to develop an integrated system solution for decentralised wastewater management in Oman. The main objective of the project is to establish a research, demonstration and training facility aiming at developing, promoting and facilitating the implementation of sustainable and effective sewage and reuse management solutions for suburban and rural communities in Oman. The procedure applied for designing the facility was comprised of two parts; the comparative analysis, which gath-ers forms and ranks information into a knowledge basis, on which the designer can make a decision and the engineering design process. With the geographic information system (GIS)-based assessment tool assessment of local lowest-cost wastewater solutions (ALLOWS) the project compares different scenarios for regional wastewater management options. ALLOWS features two main components: (1) Spatial analysis, and (2) cost assessment using net present value calculation for different scenarios for a lifetime of 80 years. In a case study, different sanitation scenarios were developed for Al Mizarih village, near Qurayyat, Oman. This preliminary assessment indicates that under current conditions a solution on household level is the most cost-effective option. However, semi-and decentralised scenarios gain in cost-effectiveness, when future population growth and settlement patterns are anticipated in the analysis.","Allows; Gis-based Assessment; Rural; Sewage; Suburban; Wastewater Management; Gis; Rural Area; Sewage; Suburban Area; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Waste Management; Wastewater; Oman","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098686707"

Therefore, this study is aimed at assessing the urban water security of Islamabad by taking both human and environmental aspects into consideration. In principle, we achieve this objective by implementing the Water Security Assessment Framework, using five distinct parameters to calculate an urban water security index. The water supply dimension incorporates availability, accessibility, affordability, and the quality of drinking water in the city, whereas, sanitation and health dimension measures access to improved drainage systems as well as the state of overall hygiene of the city inhabitants. Furthermore, the water economy dimension includes water productivity and investment aspects in the study area, while the environment and ecosystem dimension looks into the current state of natural water bodies. Similarly, overall management and public support for freshwater resources are measured in the society and governance dimension.

This paper focuses on two essential resources – nitrogen and phosphorus – and challenges their sustainable management in the water-agro-food system of Paris Megacity. An in-depth analysis of the nitrogen and phosphorus imprint of Paris Megacity was conducted, originally centered on human metabolism through consumption and excretion of these two elements. Upstream, the whole agricultural production that feeds Paris Megacity was scrutinized and nitrogen and phosphorus flows in the agro-system were fully documented. Downstream, the analysis of solid waste and wastewater management in Paris Megacity showed the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus imported into the city. Paris Megacity appears to rely on a very complex and international agro-food system, requiring high levels of chemical fertilizers and strongly impacting the environment through nutrient environmental losses. On the other hand, solid waste and wastewater management appears to be mostly disconnected from the agro-food system: even if the release of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment has largely decreased in recent years, their recycling rate remains very low. This overview of the water-agro-food system of Paris Megacity suggests that an optimal management of nitrogen and phosphorus in the three subsystems (agriculture, waste management and sanitation) should be integrated within a comprehensive approach linking agriculture and urban residues. This analysis thus constitutes a groundwork on which paradigm shift scenarios of the global water-agro-food system could be constructed.","Biogeochemical Imprint; Megacity; Nitrogen Cycle; Phosphorus Cycle; Urban Metabolism; Water-agro-food System; Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Chemical Analysis; Fertilizers; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Physiology; Solid Wastes; Sustainable Development; Waste Management; Wastewater Reclamation; Agro Foods; Biogeochemical; Megacities; Nitrogen Cycles; Phosphorus Cycles; Urban Metabolisms; Rivers; Biogeochemistry; Environmental Impact Assessment; Human Activity; Megacity; Nitrogen Cycle; Phosphorus; Resource Availability; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; France; Ile De France; Paris; Ville De Paris","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045081688"

The 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to ""Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"". One of the most significant dimensions of the SDG agenda is the emphasis on data and governance. However, the lack of good governance coupled with good observed data cannot ensure the achievement of SDG6. Therefore, this study strives to evaluate water quality status and hydrochemical processes governing it in the data-scarce Mokopane area of South Africa. Groundwater is the main source of fresh water supply for domestic usage, intensive agriculture, and mining activities in Mokopane. In this study, hydrogeochemical analysis of groundwater samples was employed to calculate the water quality index (WQI) and evaluate factors governing water quality evolution in the study area. Statistical and spatial analysis techniques were carried out to divide sampling sites into clusters and delineate principal factors responsible for determining water quality of the sampled groundwater. Results suggest that most of the physico-chemical parameters are within permissible limits for drinking water set by the World Health Organization (WHO), except for high fluoride in some samples. Na-HCO<inf>3</inf> is the most abundant water type followed by Mg-HCO<inf>3</inf>, which indicates dominance of Na+, Mg2+, and HCO<inf>3</inf>±. Rock-water interaction is the prime factor responsible for fluoride enrichment in water. The alkaline nature of groundwater favors the release of exchangeable F- from minerals like muscovite. The WQI suggests that 80% of water samples fall into the good and excellent categories. Poor management of untreated domestic sewage and agricultural runoff is a main factor for the bad/very bad categories of water samples. As the area lacks any credible scientific/government work to report water quality and its management aspects, the findings of this study will definitely help both scientific communities and policy makers to do what is needed for sustainable water resource management in a timely manner.","Geospatial Analysis; Groundwater; Hydrogeochemical Assessment; Multivariate Statistical Analysis; Water Quality Index; Agricultural Runoff; Agriculture; Alkalinity; Chemical Analysis; Climate Change; Factor Analysis; Fluorine Compounds; Groundwater; Groundwater Resources; Hydrochemistry; Land Use; Mica; Multivariant Analysis; Population Statistics; Potable Water; Sampling; Sewage; Sodium Compounds; Sustainable Development; Water Conservation; Water Management; Water Quality; Water Supply; Geo-spatial Analysis; Hydrogeochemical; Land Use/land Cover Change; Multivariate Statistical Analysis; Physico - Chemical Parameters; Sustainable Water Resources; Water Quality Indexes; World Health Organization; Quality Control; Agricultural Runoff; Drinking Water; Hydrogeochemistry; Multivariate Analysis; Policy Making; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Water Quality; Water Resource; Water Supply; Limpopo; Mokopane; South Africa","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072222227"

Commonly known as the 'water goal', SDG 6 went well beyond the limited focus on water supply and sanitation in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and recognized the importance of all aspects of the water cycle in development and that water was embedded directly and indirectly in all 17 SDGs. In 2018, the UN published a report: ""Sustainable Development Goal 6 Synthesis Report on Water and Sanitation 2018"" (referred to in this paper as 'the report') that reviewed progress with SDG 6 at global and regional levels. Overall, the report concluded there was progress, but it was too slow, and the world was not on track to achieve SDG 6 by 2030 without a significant change of gear. The report was written primarily for those working in sustainable development to guide finance and resource allocation, but there was much embedded in the report that was of value to those engaged in research and in developing the much-needed capacity to plan and manage water resources, particularly in developing countries. This paper attempts to distill these issues and to ask how those involved in education, training, and research could contribute to enabling and accelerating progress towards achieving SDG 6. Three key areas of engagement were identified: the urgent need for more data and improved monitoring to assess SDG 6 progress and to enhance decision-making, the need to address the serious lack of human and institutional capacity that was constraining progress, and the challenge of taking research into policy and practice.

Worldwide, an estimated 663 million people do not have access to sufficient and safe water for domestic use, and the demand is on the increase. It is estimated that the world will have to cope with a 40 per cent water supply shortfall by 2030, which will unavoidably affect the availability of drinking water, sanitation and food production. South Africa faces a particularly gloomy water reality. Not only is South Africa plagued by severe drought conditions, but it also has a poor record of water conservation, outdated and inadequate water treatment infrastructure, and lingering concerns about the quality and degradation of the already limited volume of available water. South Africa's political history, characterised by a reality of unequal access to water, adds additional and unique challenges as far as water resource regulation is concerned. Following the advent of the constitutional era, a novel legal framework for water resources regulation was developed in South Africa. The National Water Act 36 of 1998 (NWA) was promulgated with the primary aim of reforming the law relating to water resources. The NWA broke new ground by inter alia introducing the concept of public trusteeship into the South African water law. Section 3 of the NWA provides that all water use rights fall under the centralised control of the state, or public trustee, to improve the distribution, management, use, conservation and equitability of access to this scarce resource. Although the concept of public trusteeship entered the South African legal realm without much fanfare, it fundamentally changed the foundation and regulatory practices of the South African water law dispensation. The water regulatory framework changed from one that linked access to water to land ownership and differentiated between private and public water, to a framework that applies to “all water” in South Africa and that acknowledges that the country's water “belongs to all people”. Accordingly, the old system that provided for exclusive water use rights, and that was generally to the detriment of the majority of South Africans, has been replaced by a system that provides for water allowances granted at the discretion of government. The introduction of the notion of public trusteeship therefore denotes a major transformation in which existing property rights are re-defined. With this new system of the NWA, the South African government has effectively nationalised all of the nation's water resources. It has been almost 20 years since the transformation of South Africa's water regulatory framework, but the reality is that, despite the transformation brought about by the NWA, studies show a decline in the quantity and quality of South Africa's water resources. Adding to the problem that South Africa is a water scarce country, the demand for water is on the increase. Severe pollution such as the fact that approximately 4 billion litres of raw or partially purified sewage are discharged daily into South Africa's dams and rivers, as well as the widespread destruction of wetlands by mining and agricultural activities continue to impact negatively on the quality of the scarce water resource. One of the consequences of this is the growing presence of toxic blue-green algae in the water resources of South Africa, with an estimated 62 per cent of aquatic bodies already contaminated with cyanobacteria - the highest incidence in the world. In light of this water crisis, some may argue that the new regulatory framework, with its statutory objectives and strategies, is flawed. In order to determine whether the new regulatory framework for South Africa's water resources is indeed flawed, or whether the NWA is rather a beacon of hope amid the country's water crisis, this article analyses the novel water regulatory framework with specific reference to the concept of public trusteeship. In the second part, the article scientifically describes the state of South Africa's water resources. The third and last part of the article provides a legal response to the growing pressure on South Africa's water resources. It considers how the public trusteeship paradigm can be used to ensure that water is protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable manner, for the benefit of all persons. The article confirms that the public trust regulatory regime is sufficient for water regulation in South Africa, and particularly relevant to a solution to the country's water crisis, as it offers the necessary mechanisms to achieve lasting protection for water resources, and ultimately to enhance sustainable water resource management.","Accountability; Fiduciary Responsibility; Public Trusteeship; Solutions; Water Crisis; Water Degradation","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054002048"

Universitas Sebelas Maret is one of Campus in Indonesia, which has awareness toward water and sanitation, especially related to the problem of waste. Liquid waste has become problems for a long time in UNS, when domestic liquid waste has come from residential areas surrounding campus passed through the lake in campus before finally flowing to Bengawan Solo River. This causes euthropication and sedimentation of the lake of UNS, which had impact on extremelly decreased the function of the pond estetically and functionally. By partnership with the Ministry of Public Works anad Spatial Planning in 2017, UNS has built Integrated Waste Water Treatment, which treats domestic liquid waste from residential area surrounding campus and internal campus becomes recycled clean water.

SDG 6 expands the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. A UN report in 2017 states that likely over 80% of the wastewater worldwide is still discharged without adequate treatment. In several countries the wastewater management is nowadays a norm, but still there are open discussions about the kind of approach to be adopted, i.e. centralisation vs. decentralisation. The choice of the adopted technologies is strictly linked to environmental performances and economical aspects; one of the possible causes for the still enormous amount of untreated wastewater discharged into the environment can be the low “willingness to pay” for this kind of service and therefore a great focus should be given to all the technologies that are able to lower the treatment costs still maintaining reliable and robust performances in the long term. When considering wastewater as a carrier of valuable primary chemicals that can be easily converted to marketable products (fertilisers, bio-plastics, soil conditioners, biofuels, etc.), and as well as a relevant source of “new water” to be used for specific purposes, wastewater and runoff management can be highlighted as one of the most exciting challenges and occasions for a sustainable development in the near future. The paper aims to clarify the future role of CWs in circular economy, resource-oriented, and ecosystem services approaches, which want to respond to sanitation worldwide and the future research needs. We give an overview on how the conventional wastewater treatment scheme (what we call “waste paradigm”) should move towards more sustainable water and biogeochemical cycles following the new resource-oriented, circular economy and ecosystem service views.

Since the 90s many scholars, activists and politicians have critically assessed sustainable development and considered it an oxymoron in the context of current global capital accumulation. This paper takes the matter seriously and explores the limits and possibilities of researching water management towards Sustainable Development Goal 6: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”. The analysis will touch upon three main fields of enquiry, namely the creation of a world water crisis regime, the encounter of diverse water ontologies while dealing with water management, and the raising of the human right to water and sanitation as a counter-point to the privatization of water resources. Sustainable development requires a stronger inclusion of human rights principles to become a more inspiring narrative for theoretical analysis and transformative interventions. It is argued that embedding sustainable development together with the political and cultural struggles of the human rights idiom, as exemplified in the case of the human right to water and sanitation, could provide a better framework to make sustainable development a useful tensional concept to reflect upon for building more equalitarian societies, and thus to care for life and the environment, within and outside universities.","Culture; Global Regime; Human Rights; Sustainability; Water","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071535655"

It is projected that by 2030, more than 50 trillion will need to be invested in infrastructure globally to keep up with GDP, urbanization and climatic changes. Investments of this magnitude can only be delivered through collaboration between cities, regions, and international businesses and investors. Where there are gaps between public funds availability and the needs, Public-Private-Partnerships need to be evaluated and structured to close the gaps. International collaboration common in scientific research, education and finance need to be transposed to capacity building and management of multi-faceted infrastructure projects. Advanced countries can collaborate with regional country counterparts to projects execution, financing and timely delivery. Geo-collaboration enables cities in regional economies to boost their effectiveness by bringing international know-how directly to projects facilitators. Buildings systems including lighting and HVAC consume nearly 40% of total energy use. To lower their carbon footprint, buildings need to perform better than they had been doing, environmentally, economically and socially. Need in regional economies is for open innovations for self sustainable habitats with minimum pollution levels, optimized energy supplies, adequate security, scalable and adaptable to different situations. A well coordinated collaborative approach is favored to benefit from nexus between smart buildings, HVAC systems, IAQ, environment, power and water infrastructure. There are already collaborative activities, such as regional satellites, regional countries collaboration, National League of Cities, C40 Cities, 100 Resilient Cities, Future-Cities-Collaborative for shared benefits. In the future, the combination of power, water and communications infrastructure with real time data analytics and potential use of Artificial Intelligence will bring us high performance cities and buildings that can also adopt to global weather changes and emergencies. This paper presents a conceptual framework for development of robust, and resilient infrastructure to suit the needs of regional economies along with fostering skills and job creation. A new approach of using open innovation with a geo-collaborative vision, knowledge, skills, experience and strategies for effective and sustainable delivery of services, goods and policies is discussed. Technologies need to be adapted to serve local needs commensurate with global experiences, to ensure that the right technologies and applications are employed in the right environments, tailored to the specific cultural, social and economic characteristics of the individual city.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062678268"

The issues of leakage and spillage of Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs) and Aqueous Phase Liquids (APLs) contribute to groundwater contamination, resulting in groundwater pollution and rendering the quality of groundwater unsafe for drinking and agriculture. Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all were the goal and target of the 2030 United Nations agenda for sustainable development, consisting of a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. This paper investigates the aqueous and non-aqueous phase liquid migrations in the deformable double-porosity soil, which has become important for sustainability of groundwater utilisation and a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of liquid migration into the groundwater. An experiment model was conducted to study the pattern and behaviour of aqueous and non-aqueous phase liquid migration in deformable double-porosity soil using digital image processing technique. The results of the experiments show that the flow of the APL and NAPL migration was not uniformly downward. Faster migration occurs at the cracked soil surface condition compared to other locations on the soil surface that were not cracked, even when not using liquid such as toluene. The factors that significantly influence the APL and NAPL migration are the structure of the soil sample, fracture pattern of the soil sample, physical interaction bonding between the liquid and soil sample, and the capillary pressure of the fluid. This study indicates that digital image analysis provides detailed information to facilitate researchers to better understand and simulate the pattern of liquids migration characteristics as well as to ensure sustainable consumption of groundwater.","Climate Change; Cracks; Deformation; Disasters; Groundwater; Image Analysis; Liquids; Porosity; Soil Surveys; Soils; Sustainable Development; Water Management; Digital Image Analysis; Digital Image Processing Technique; Double-porosity Soils; Drinking And Agricultures; Groundwater Contamination; Nonaqueous Phase Liquids; Sustainable Consumption; Sustainable Management; Groundwater Pollution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047335535"

Biochars, with excellent capacity to remove several contaminants from aqueous solutions, constitute an untapped technology for drinking water treatment. Biochar water treatment has several potential merits compared to existing low-cost methods (i.e., sand filtration, boiling, solar disinfection, chlorination): (1) biochar is a low-cost and renewable adsorbent made using readily available biomaterials and skills, making it appropriate for low-income communities; (2) existing methods predominantly remove pathogens, but biochars remove chemical, biological and physical contaminants; (3) biochars maintain organoleptic properties of water, while existing methods generate carcinogenic by-products (e.g., chlorination) and/or increase concentrations of chemical contaminants (e.g., boiling). Biochars have co-benefits including provision of clean energy for household heating and cooking, and soil application of spent biochar improves soil quality and crop yields. Integrating biochar into the water and sanitation system transforms linear material flows into looped material cycles, consistent with terra preta sanitation. Lack of design information on biochar water treatment, and environmental and public health risks constrain the biochar technology. Seven hypotheses for future research are highlighted under three themes: (1) design and optimization of biochar water treatment; (2) ecotoxicology and human health risks associated with contaminant transfer along the biochar-soil-food-human pathway, and (3) life cycle analyses of carbon and energy footprints of biochar water treatment systems.","Adsorption; Inorganic Contaminants; Pathogenic Organisms; Sustainable Development Goals; Synthetic And Emerging Contaminants; Charcoal; Water; Biochar; Charcoal; Soil; Water; Drinking Water; Biochar; Charcoal; Soil; Water; Adsorption; Aqueous Solution; Inorganic Matter; Life Cycle Analysis; Pathogen; Pollutant Removal; Sustainable Development; Waste Technology; Wastewater Treatment; Water Management; Carcinogenicity; Chlorination; Controlled Study; Cooking; Cost; Filtration; Harvest; Health Hazard; Heating; Household; Human; Lowest Income Group; Process Optimization; Renewable Energy; Review; Soil Quality; Waste Component Removal; Waste Water Management; Water Flow; Water Treatment; Charcoal; Humans; Soil; Water; Water Purification","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018638822"

Based on the analysis of 26 in-depth interviews with key informants about the current processes, technologies and multiplicities of governance approaches, we demonstrate how the private sector does not only play a significant role in shaping the water dialogue but also has introduced its own modes of governance, which sometimes usurps preferences for public services. Ultimately, differences in procedural legalities and functionalities have spurred (un)healthy competition between the multiple governance modes, spearheaded by the private firms. Concluding, we caution that the multiplicity of management practices devoid of efficient and effective regulatory framework creates indecisive outcomes. Further, we suggest that the development of water-related capacity, both at the individual and institutional levels, will be fundamental in the realization of sustainable development goal 6 by 2030.","Disadvantaged Communities; Independent Water Providers; Inefficient Regulatory Framework; Metropolitan Accra; Sustainable Development Goal 6; Community Development; Poverty; Questionnaire Survey; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Urbanization; Water Planning; Water Stress; Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013092828"

Consequently, water has a variety of qualifications and uses. It may be qualified as a public good, a commodity, a human right, or perhaps even as part of the common heritage of mankind. As a precious resource, managing its distribution among different uses is fundamentally important. And it is in this way that international law can play a significant role, alongside the contribution of other disciplines such as economics. The law applicable to water can be apprehended through various strands that are each discernible from one another, but that are also intertwined. They concern economic activities and uses, environmental protection, as well as human-centred uses and needs. As water cannot be managed for any single use, there is a need to reconcile these strands. This should be done in an integrated manner, that is to say a coherent, holistic, and interdisciplinary approach is needed to ensure a sound and equitable management of fresh water resources. Economic activities comprise multiple uses of fresh water, such as navigation, irrigation, the generation of hydroelectric power, and the supply of water for industrial and domestic uses, to name just a few examples. Fresh water as a natural resource is also increasingly seen as a source of profit. This is most evident in the context of the international trade of goods and services, as well as investment law, and may also be seen in respect of international bulk transfers of water. Water in itself has indeed become a source of profit, with international investment law and international trade law bringing this characteristic into sharp focus. In this context, the progressive recognition of the critical link between economic activities and the promotion of human development and the environment is profoundly important. There is a need to overcome tensions that may arise when these various objectives are pursued. Access to water and sanitation for all human beings should be a common objective and end. The newly adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and more particularly SDG 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), highlights this crucial need.","","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048165867"

In this paper, we explore one possible barrier to success: a potential misalignment between local and outside motivations. We address this problem by analyzing how strategies used to successfully (n = 148) and unsuccessfully (n = 70) deliver drinking water to rural areas align with known motivations of local stakeholders. As one tool and starting point, we use definitions in Maslow’s theory of motivation to learn and share how to more consistently and successfully build comprehensive motivations into solutions. The results reveal that successful strategies rarely focus on physiological needs (2/148) and often focus on higher-level needs, including self-esteem (75/148), love and belonging (46/148), and safety (69/148). Successful strategies also typically address multiple needs and are designed to meet the actualization (fulfill potential) of both communities and donors. Unsuccessful strategies focus on needs of outside stakeholders above local stakeholders (46/70), fail to address higher-level or multiple needs, and/or unsuccessfully address existing needs.","Behavior Change; Motivation; Rural; Sustainability; Water","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975789858"

Conjugation of personal initiative and institutional to political will, in order to design and compliance of measures intended to ensure the sustainable protection of the space in which as human beings live together, is a new way to govern human resources and actions by reconsidering the nature, the rights and obligations arising from this trend. The link between water and the environment is indisputable. Water is one of the most important elements of the environment and is present in air, soil and in the body of living creatures. It is a vital part of the metabolic processes of living organisms. Therefore, whatever form occurs in nature, water is life being indispensable to biological existence on this planet. Waters from the surface of the globe play important roles in human evolution; rivers and irrigation provides water intake for agriculture, are supporting maritime or river, either commercial or recreational. There are many factors that can cause uncertainty in meeting current and future water need from population growth to global warming. For this reason it is very important that people do their best to protect drinking water sources, to reduce waste and water pollution. Thus,it arises more and more acute the need to manage water resources that humanity currently has in order to ensure the right to water for each individual. In this respect at global, regional and local level in the political and academic environment emerged and naturalized the notion of Water Governance explained as the ability of a social system to develop public policies to mobilize the energies of different stakeholders in a coherent sustainable development of water resources. Achieving the water governance and the access to water require reducing poverty, economic recovery and environmental protection. The installation of water governance involves the implemention of an integrated management of water resources. The present work tries to outline on the one hand, the water governance having as support the fundamental human right to water and sanitation as a result of EU Water Framework Directive transposition in Romanian law in order to create the premises for a sustainable protection of the environment, and to exemplify, on the other hand, people's perceptions on the efforts of a local operator from hydrographic basin faction to ensure access requirements and water quality objectives of integrated management of water resources.","Acceptability; Accessibility; Environmental Protection; Integrated Water Management; Sustainable Development; The Fundamental Right To Water Availability; Water Governance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874917594"

The lack of access to clean water is a serious health concern. According to reports, worldwide, over a million deaths per year have been attributed to unsafe water and poor sanitation, with close to 90% of these deaths occurring in children under five years of age. This study was therefore, aimed at reviewing and evaluating the Nigerian drinking water supply and distribution sector, with particular reference to the historical perspective and organization structure; water law and profile in respect to meeting the millennium development goal target for improved water supply and distribution. Although there is temporal and spatial variation in water availability between the North and the South in Nigeria, the country is considered to be abundantly blessed with water resources. Nigeria has a national water supply policy, whose objective is to ensure adequate, affordable and sustainable access to safe drinking water for all citizens. Despite the existence of several government agencies, whose roles are to enhance efficient water supply and distribution to all citizens in Nigeria, current access to improved drinking water in Nigeria is still low, with improved water supply and increasing from 47% in 1990 to 58% in 2008. According to report, Nigeria water supply situation has not kept pace in meeting the millennium development goal target of 75% coverage for safe drinking water. For improved water supply coverage, there is the need for enforceable water legislation, building of institutions and policies related to water resource planning, development and management, demand management and privatization of the water supply and distribution sector. Through deliberate reorganization of socioeconomic policies regarding the water supply sector, a significant increase in the proportion of people with access to improved drinking water source can be attained. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Improved Drinking Water; Water Distribution; Water Supply; Discharge; Drinking Water; Environmental Policy; Millenium Development Goal; Sanitation; Spatial Variation; Wastewater; Water Availability; Water Management; Water Planning; Water Supply; Water Treatment; Nigeria","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959258478"

A brief examination of a series of excreta and wastewater management systems from around the world and throughout history clearly shows that viewing faeces, urine and grey water as a worthless waste to be disposed of is only a modern concept, which ignores the realities of limited resource availability, and the obvious benefits to be had from closed-loop systems - as was clearly recognised in the past. While currently, expensive, technically complicated end-of-pipe sanitation systems dominate, several modern systems have been developed specifically to ensure an efficient resource recovery and reuse. Reconsidering and researching historical approaches to wastewater management and applying modern technologies to improve their functionality may contribute to the solution of many of today's sanitation and environmental problems. © IWA Publishing 2007.","Agriculture; Excreta And Greywater Reuse; Sanitation Philosophy; Wastewater Management Systems; Environmental Impact; Sanitation; Sustainable Development; Wastewater; Excreta And Greywater Reuse; Sanitation Philosophy; Wastewater Management Systems; Water Management; Rain; Agriculture; Pipe; Resource Availability; Sanitation; Sustainability; Technological Development; Wastewater; Water Management; Water Technology; Agricultural Management; Contamination; Environmental Health; Feces; Fluid Intake; Health Hazard; Human; Review; Sewage Treatment; Waste Water Management; Water Pollution; Water Supply; World Health Organization","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34248569501"

Addressing a panel on the growing water needs of cities, N'Dow, the Secretary General of Habitat II, said lack of water is one of the 'most critical factors' that cause conflict. N'Dow urged city officials, nongovernmental organizations and other Habitat players to act on the recommendations of the panel, which he labeled ""the single most important dialogue at this conference."" N'Dow stressed cost effectiveness, better technology, and new management systems as the three most important elements of a new strategy. More than 1 billion people worldwide--mostly in poor countries--do not have access to safe drinking water. Also, most of the world's largest cities, including some in rich countries, do not treat their waste water adequately. The challenge for growing cities, UN officials say, is not just to provide safe water but also to ensure the poor can afford it. ""Habitat is a wake-up call, as 40% of city residents do not have water,"" said Beatrice Labonne, director of the UN's Division for Environment Management and Social Development. Currently, subsidies skew water prices overwhelmingly in favor of the rich. In Jakarta, Indonesia, piped water accounts for only 14% of the total water supply, according to the World Bank. Many poor residents shut out of the system have to pay more than 20 times the price paid by the rich. Water pricing has long been a hot political issue, which is partly why the World Bank and the UN have called for privatization of the water sector. But, they say, governments must regulate the firms to guarantee safe water and fair pricing. Privatization is seen as a solution to manipulation of government utilities by vested interests. For example, governments often grant huge concessions to industry as a means of helping the latter create more jobs. Last March, Habitat organized a meeting in Beijing of more than 150 city officials, NGOs, and other conference participants as a precursor to the Istanbul event. With the official conference underway, they will brief delegates on the future vision of these players. full text","Article; Environment; Environmental Protection; Health; International Cooperation; Natural Resources; Public Health; Safety; Sanitation; Water Supply; World; Environment; Health; International Cooperation; Public Health; Safety; Sanitation; Water Supply; Conservation Of Natural Resources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030572176"
