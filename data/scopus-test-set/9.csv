As the population of developing countries is growing exponentially every year, there is an alarming situation to overcome the above-stated issue. Furthermore, the resources required to fulfil this gap also depleting. There is an immediate urgency to switch over to sustainable development; thereby, the depletion of available resources is minimal. The practices adopted among developing countries to achieve sustainable development such as design, durability, energy efficiency, waste reduction, indoor air quality, water conservation, and building materials are discussed with relevant case studies. The target status achieved for “sustainable development goal 9—build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation” was also discussed.","Sustainable Building Practices; Sustainable Construction; Sustainable Development Goal","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002446211"

It is a concept that has in the recent years been receiving much attention. In this view, much of the scholarly attention has been given to the benefits of frugal innovation. However, sparse and little attention has been given to the possibilities and challenges of frugal innovation in attaining sustainable development in African Nations. Much of the work has explored the benefits of disruptive frugal innovation. Given this background, this chapter, therefore, seeks to contribute to disruptive frugal digital innovation by highlighting the challenges and possibilities frugal innovation brings in an attempt to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) especially SDG 1 that aims to end poverty in all forms as well as SDG 8 that aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation. Hence, this chapter aims to unleash some possibilities and challenges that can be brought by frugal innovation. Using literature analysis from 21 articles from Google Scholar, the chapter pre-empts key definitions and highlights the SDGs, the possibilities and challenges brought by frugal innovation in achieving economic and social sustainability in Africa. It is through these insights that the chapter seeks to informtheory, practice and policy in the context of SDGs in Africa.","Africa; Digital Innovation; Frugal Innovation; Social Innovation; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001893610"

Writing on this, Datta intimated that the digital revolution is a key moment that is “shaping current state policies and practices of planning and governance in the global south”. These policies are in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among leading experts, there is a general agreement that ICTs can help to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. This is why, as UNDP rightly notes, “since 2015, countries have harnessed digital technology to accelerate progress towards achieving of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030”. However, even with these utopian promises, pervasive challenges persist as growth in digital usage is sitting side by side with the pervasive digital inequality, especially groups in the margins. This study looks at two minority groups of Zimbabwe: the Shangaan/Tsonga tribe and the Tonga tribe. Critically, this study sought to understand the state of digitisation among Zimbabwe’s ethnic minorities, groups often marginalised when it comes to national developments.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212595364"

SDG 9 aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation,” while SDG 16 aims to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.” The chapter discusses the principles of unitisation and cross-border unitisation, the process for achieving an efficient cross-border unitisation, and how the goals of SDG 9and SDG 16 can be achieved through cross-border unitisation. It concludes that cross-border unitisation is one way in which countries demonstrate that they embrace the SDGs, although the SDGs in and of themselves do not primarily promote cross-border unitisation as the parties involved in the petroleum operations are mainly driven by commercial motive. However, embracing unitisation as a commercial necessity promotes the SDG goals.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193325086"

Although road traffic accidents are a common occurrence in most countries, there is evidence indicating that the number of actual accidents is not properly reported. The proof can be evaluated from a mismatched record between the police and hospital data. This concern has a significant impact on public safety and other components of a country as well. In layman's terms, ""underreporting"" is the act of reporting fewer numbers than the exact count. In justifying this prevailing research situation, this paper applies the Bibliometric Analysis using the Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny software packages to analyze and visualize the data of a search conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection Database yielded publication results spanning from 1970 to 2023.

This study is expected to provide an overview of underreporting of road traffic accidents. The impact of underreporting contributes to the setback of incomplete statistical analysis.

Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation). The measurement of the innovation level of world economies has been of interest for several years for both economic theoreticians and practitioners. However, the real innovation level of world economies can be evaluated on the basis of a much more limited set of diagnostic features available in official statistics. That is why the main objective of the work is to assess the level of innovation of the European Union Member States based on the composite index which was proposed by authors using variables indicated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development strategy. The following specific objectives have been formulated as part of the main objective: (i) comparing the level of innovation of EU Member States based on the results of the ranking constructed by the authors; (ii) simplifying the tools for assessing activities undertaken under the 2030 Agenda strategy; (iii) building a tool that will allow for a long-term assessment of the effectiveness of measures to strengthen innovation within the framework of the sustainable development policy indicated in the 2030 Agenda; (iv) comparison of the results of the conducted research with the Summary Innovation Index (SII) published in the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS), which in the literature on the subject is one of the most frequently used rankings for assessing the level of innovation in European countries. The comparative analysis carried out here is intended to highlight that the level of innovation of European Union member states can be described equally well on the basis of a limited set of diagnostic features. The taxonomic measure of development based on the Weber median vector was used in the paper to assess the innovation level of the EU Member States. The research was conducted based on the indicators applied by Eurostat to monitor the implementation of Goal 9 of the 2030 Agenda. The applied method and the results obtained can be used in subsequent years to examine the direction of changes observed also from the point of view of the particular EU Member States in the area of the application of innovations for the implementation of sustainable development policy.","Innovation; Innovation Measurement; R&d; Responsible Entrepreneurship; Sustainable Development Indicators; Taxonomic Measure; Development Strategy; Environmental Economics; European Union; Future Prospect; Innovation; Literature Review; Policy Implementation; Research And Development; Sustainable Development; Europe","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051789469"
