Save for informal seed systems, smallholders have few sources to turn to for quality seed of local staples, like sorghum, beans, and sweet potato. This is despite large public investments in developing improved varieties of such crops. Objective: We revisit the debate on whether farmer seed enterprise is a viable missing middle between formal and informal seed systems and assess the business case of the model known as local seed business (LSB). To this end, we ask the questions: 1. What is the LSB niche; 2. What is the business model; 3. Is it viable, if so; 4. Under what conditions, and; 5. What is its contribution to seed availability and the agricultural economy? Methods: We evaluate the business case for LSB through the systems perspectives of integrated seed sector development and market archetypes. Further to making inductions about the niche and business model using these concepts, we document the institutions conducive to LSBs' viability and measure LSBs' contribution in economic terms. Data were collected from case studies of the programs of Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD) in Ethiopia, Uganda, and Myanmar using internal documents and opinions elicited during experts' consultation. Results and conclusions: The LSB ‘niche’ is the gap left between commercial entities and the development community intervening to improve certain households' welfare outcomes. Whilst LSBs capture small premiums compared to companies, margins are modestly positive. The presence of support – like which ISSD provided – is prerequisite for startup. The model's viability depends upon continued support in accessing affordable early generation seed and seed quality assurance services. We conclude that LSB complements rather than competes with other forms of seed entrepreneurship by broadening the products on offer, deploying new and improved varieties of crops considered commercially less interesting, and accessing harder-to-reach markets. Significance: The systems perspective applied in our article refutes the notion that one size fits all and departs from the dichotomy that seed systems are either formal or informal. It is also an interesting case of niche innovation and strategic niche management in seed systems change. Supporting LSB is a worthwhile policy option to catalyze public investments in variety development and contribute to SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.","Common Good; Marginal Economic Value; Market Archetype; Niche Innovation; Seed System; Smallholder; Food Security; Innovation; Maize; Market Conditions; Nutrition; Rice; Smallholder; Asia; Uganda","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011209401"

By the end of this decade, there will be more than 1.5 billion people living in India, and this number will rise until 2064. Population pressure leads to several threats like water paucity, desertification, high food crisis, and salinization. As a priority, the second goal of the 17 UN sustainable development goals (SDG) is SDG 2: “Zero hunger”: To end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. To meet the demand of the growing food crisis there is a need for sustainable culture systems. Aquaponic system offers the solution for the problem. Aquaponic system is an intensive, resource-efficient, closed-loop agricultural food production system, that symbiotically integrates aquaculture and hydroponics to produce fish and multiple cash crops with minimal area, reduced water, and fertilizer inputs. The wastes (faecal, uneaten feed) produced in the fish culturing system are converted by nitrifying bacteria into a form that plants can utilize for their growth, acting like a biofilter and remediating the culture water before recirculating into the fish tank. Aquaponics technology was developed in the 1970s focused on integrated fish production systems with vegetables. Now aquaponics is widely popular in many countries for commercial scale application mainly for many food fish like Oreochromis niloticus (Graber and Junge, 2009), catfishes (Endut et al., 2009), Oncorhynchus mykiss (Forchino et al., 2017), Cyprinus carpio (Shete et al., 2017), Lates calcarifer (Stathopoulou et al., 2021), and Piaractus mesopotamicus (Pinho et al., 2018). The culture of many species of ornamental fishes like Koi carps, Goldfish, gourami, and livebearers is also being practised in aquaponic system in many countries like Italy, etc. The demand for ornamental fishes is regularly increasing in India as the hobby of aquarium keeping is growing continuously (Jain et al., 2016), and the trend has been further bolstered by the inclusion of the ornamental fisheries sector as one of the focus areas under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojna (PMMSY). However, the increasing urbanization in existing ornamental fish farming hubs of India like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerla demands effective utilization of resources for high profitability. This has resulted in the integration of aquaponic technology for the culture of ornamental fishes at many farming facilities.","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002898787"

Success will be dependent on our ability to preserve the economic sustainability of livestock production in small-holder farming systems which will require regenerative approaches to reverse land degradation and retain biodiversity. Animal products are important components of world food baskets because their nutrient profile most closely resembles the dietary requirements of mankind. Key micronutrients, including iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12, zinc and iodine, are more readily available from animal-sourced foods, which are critical for a balanced diet for those with higher nutrient requirements such as growing children and pregnant and lactating women. The developing Asian economy of Laos, together with that of the Pacific Island nations of Vanuatu and Samoa provide some interesting contrasts in servicing the nutritional needs of their predominantly rural populations as their respective governments address the issues of undernutrition and hidden hunger. The paper explores some of the challenges that governments face in sustaining resilient animal production to supply essential nutrients for food baskets across our region. These include the broader contexts of resource availability, education, cultural traditions, socioeconomic status, gender equality and women’s empowerment.","Animal Products; Farmers; Food Baskets; Global Warming; Green-house Gas; Hidden Hunger; Micronutrients; Small Holder; Sustainability; Food Security; Gender; Global Warming; Hunger; Land Degradation; Literature Review; Livestock Farming; Nutrient; Rural Population; Smallholder; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Trace Element; United Nations; Laos; Pacific Islands; Samoa; Vanuatu","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201919841"

According to the 2023 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the world is not on track to end hunger or promote sustainable agriculture by that time. Climate change acts as a “crisis multiplier”, resulting in lower food productivity and higher prices, contributing further to poverty, hunger, and instability. The number of undernourished people in drought-sensitive and low-income regions of the world has increased this decade. In this review, we analyze the potential of microalgae and cyanobacteria to aid conventional agriculture in providing critical services such as carbon capture, wastewater management, food/feed, biofuels, and other higher value bioproducts. Specifically, we focus on the use of filamentous N<inf>2</inf>-fixing cyanobacteria for providing those benefits, even in semidry regions of the world with limited access to affordable nitrogen fertilizers to boost crop productivity. We comprehensively consider the eco-physiological basis of this potential, and the available alternative technologies for large-scale biomass production. We analyze venues for filamentous N<inf>2</inf>-fixing cyanobacteria applications in standalone processes, or integrated into more complex industrial symbioses, towards increased crop productivity, and water and N-fertilizer use efficiency. Throughout the text, we highlight aspects which still require further optimization, or technological breakthroughs, for full realization of the potential of filamentous N<inf>2</inf>-fixing cyanobacteria for contributing to Sustainable Development Goals.

To examine this, we assessed 97,392 publications published between 2017 and 2021 whose research results supposedly support the achievement of SDG 2. We found that the vast majority of articles had only a superficial engagement with SDG 2, suggesting a lack of interest by food system researchers in the 2030 UN agenda and a widespread practice of ‘SDG-washing’.

The damage caused to managed and natural systems by soil degradation threatens livelihoods and local services and leads to national socio-economic disruption. Human-induced soil degradation results from land clearing and deforestation, inappropriate agricultural practices, improper management of industrial effluents and wastes, careless management of forests, surface mining, urban sprawl, and ill-planned commercial and industrial development. Of these, inappropriate agricultural practices, including excessive tillage and use of heavy machinery, over-grazing, excessive and unbalanced use of inorganic fertilizers, poor irrigation and water management techniques, pesticide overuse, inadequate crop residue and/or organic carbon inputs, and poor crop cycle planning, account for nearly 40% (121 Mha) of land degradation across India. Globally, human activities related to agriculture contribute to the transgression of four of the nine Planetary Boundaries proposed by Rockström et al. (2009): Climate Change, Biodiversity Integrity, Land-system Change, and altered Phosphorus and Nitrogen Biogeochemical Flows. This review focuses on how knowledge of soil processes in agriculture has developed in India over the past 10 years, and the potential of soil science to meet the objectives of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger (End hunger, achieve food security, improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture), using the context of the four most relevant Planetary Boundaries as a framework. Solutions to mitigate soil degradation and improve soil health in different regions using conservation agricultural approaches have been proposed. Thus, in this review we (1) summarize the outputs of recent innovative research in India that has explored the impacts of soil degradation on four Planetary Boundaries (Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss, Land-system Change, and altered Biogeochemical Flows of Phosphorus and Nitrogen) and vice-versa; and (2) identify the knowledge gaps that require urgent attention to inform developing soil science research agendas in India, to advise policy makers, and to support those whose livelihoods rely on the land.","Altered Phosphorus And Nitrogen Biogeochemical Cycles; Biodiversity Loss; Climate Change; Conservation Agriculture; Land-system Change; Agricultural Land; Anthropocene; Biogeochemical Cycle; Crop Residue; Land Degradation; Land Use Change; Organic Carbon; Soil Degradation; Soil Science; India","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165447651"

This study aims to find out the determinants of ready-to-eat food consumption in that province as well to evaluate the citizen’s awareness of healthy food in their daily nutritional intake. Panel data analysis is used to establish these determinants. The results show that during 2016-2020 the consumption of ready-to-eat food tends to increase. These findings indicate that people do not really care about the nutritional balance of the food they consume. Food expenditure, total expenditure, and consumer price index have a positive effect on the level of ready-to-eat food consumption while gross regional domestic product has a negative effect. Higher healthy food intake can be achieved by reducing the consumption of unhealthy ready-to-eat food and providing ready-to-eat products that meet health standards. The reduction can be done by among others, increasing household income and lowering prices of both food and non-food commodities.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146705654"

The study examines the status of SDG Two in South African context. The guiding question for the study is: “what are the challenges related to SDG Two implementation in South Africa”? To find answers, a qualitative desktop analysis with a descriptive research design was used to acquire enough data for the study. The study used literature and document reviews as secondary sources for data collection. The journal articles, internet-based information, research reports, dissertations, theses, government documents, Acts, media reports, and annual reports, were reviewed as secondary sources of information. Data analysis for this study was done using document analysis and conceptual analysis. The literature review has revealed problems with food security initiatives' policy implementation. It is necessary to investigate the causes and henceforth find solutions to apply these initiatives successfully. There is also a need for transparency amongst state departments to collaborate while executing the implementation plans effectively.","Ecology Theory; Food Security; Sdg Two; South Africa; Sustainable Development Goal (sdg)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205337836"

The 17 SDGs are intended to be a global instrument to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities and vulnerabilities, within the sustainable human development paradigm. The pandemic highlighted, amplified and deepened social dynamics that put a strain on the state’s capacity to manage the public sector and challenged democratic institutionality. This situation led to a reassessment of the national state’s role and the measures required to solve it. On the one hand, public policies aimed at boosting reactivation and attending to the economic sectors most affected by the crisis were encouraged. On the other hand, public policies were designed to provide direct assistance to companies, workers and citizens. This revived the debate on basic rent or universal citizen income, the tax on large fortunes, and other economic compensation and redistribution measures. Our work is structured in three parts.

Adoption of this farming system can contribute to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. However, the adoption rate of this new farming technique by smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is low. The trade-offs and synergies related to the three pillars that anchor CA have not, however, been investigated in the context of Botswana. Farmers are faced with trade-offs in the use of crop residue in CA as mulch with traditional use as feed for livestock. This paper reviews the components of CA with a view to contribute to the development of CA strategies for Botswana. We show that adoption of CA in SSA is challenged by lack of weed control measures, the lack of a market for grain legumes and competing uses of crop residue. The paper highlights the discrepancy between CA methods and current government subsidies, issues that may restrain the adoption of CA in Botswana. The paper concludes by making recommendations for research and policy development for sustainable CA practices in Botswana.","Adoption; Challenges; Cover Crop; Crop Diversification; Crop Residue; Crop Rotations; No-till; Alternative Agriculture; Cover Crop; Crop Residue; Crop Rotation; Farmers Attitude; Farming System; Sustainable Development Goal; Technology Adoption; Zero Tillage; Africa; Botswana","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177214749"

The aim of this chapter is to draw lessons from Zimbabwe on how local food systems can be strengthened to cope with COVID-19 pandemic and other shocks. To this end, an online survey was conducted with 46 people with purposively sampled participants representing development partners, academia, research organisations, civil society organisations, think tanks and the private sector. Key informant interviews (KIIs) (15 in total) with a subset of them complemented the survey. The study used descriptive statistics to analyse quantitative data, while qualitative data was analysed thematically. The majority of respondents agreed that it is important to formulate policies and programmes that focus on building resilience of local food systems to withstand shocks and emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting local food production, building resilience of local communities, shortening food supply chains and designing effective social protection programmes are some of the important factors that were highlighted as being essential in strengthening local food systems to respond to shocks. The study concludes that adequate budgetary support and capacitating the local people to deal with and recover from shocks are also key ingredients in supporting the local food systems during COVID-19 pandemic and other shocks.","Covid-19 Pandemic; Local Food Systems; Resilience; Shocks","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160118880"

There have been rapid and continuous improvements in agricultural productivity and better food security in many regions of the world during the past 50 years due to an expansion in crop area, irrigation, and supportive policy and institutional initiatives. However, in Sub-Saharan Africa, the situation is inverted. Statistics show that food insecurity has risen since 2015 in Sub-Saharan African countries, and the situation has worsened owing to the Ukraine conflict and the ongoing implications of the COVID-19 threat. This review looks into multidimensional challenges to achieving the SDG2 goal of “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture” in Sub-Saharan Africa and the prosper policy recommendations for action. Findings indicate that weak economic growth, gender inequality, high inflation, low crop productivity, low investment in irrigated agriculture and research, climate change, high population growth, poor policy frameworks, weak infrastructural development, and corruption are the major hurdles in the sustaining food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. Promoting investments in agricultural infrastructure and extension services together with implementing policies targeted at enhancing the households’ purchasing power, especially those in rural regions, appear to be essential drivers for improving both food availability and food access.","Food Security; Inequality; Policy; Sdg2; Sub-saharan Africa; Alternative Agriculture; Covid-19; Food Policy; Food Security; Sustainable Development Goal; Africa South Of The Sahara; Anemia; Climate Change; Conflict; Corruption; Crop Production; Drought; Ecology; Economic Aspect; Environmental Sustainability; Food Availability; Gender Inequality; Global Food Security; Health Care Quality; Human; Hunger; Inflation (economics); Irrigation (agriculture); Population; Review; Rural Health Care; Traffic And Transport; Ukraine; Agriculture; Catering Service; Epidemiology; Procedures; Sub-saharan Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Agriculture; Food Security; Food Supply; Humans","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142527566"

Transforming Food Systems for Affordable Healthy” (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, Rome 2020) reveals that the world is not on track to achieve the SDG 2.1 (“Universal access to safe and nutritious food”) and SDG 2.2 (“End of all forms of malnutrition”), both Zero Hunger of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (“End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”) targets by 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. If recent trends continue, the number of people affected by hunger would increase further. The combination of moderate and more severe levels of food insecurity raises the estimate to over 25% of the world population, equivalent to a total of about 2 billion people. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems and of all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of food so that this circumstance further questions the achievement of the goal Zero Hunger. A very important tool to successfully tackle this serious and long-standing problem is represented by nutraceutical products and in the rehabilitation of severe patients and undernourished children, the “ready-to-use therapeutic foods” (RUTFs) have shown remarkable efficacy. They refer to a number of varieties of ready-to-eat foods, ranging from those prepared from locally available ingredients by village women in their own self-help groups for the malnourished children to those prepared according to specific formulas in worldwide factories. RUTF now almost always refers to the latter and it is a generic term including different types of foodstuff, such as spreads or compressed products with precise amounts of nutrients, mainly derived from powdered milk, peanut, oil, sugar, and micronutrients, providing energy equivalent to WHO requirement. However, the local availability of the necessary ingredients limits the production in geographical areas where their use is required, thus there are currently important efforts in the research for alternative ingredients to overcome this limitation. The purpose of this study is to trace the current scenario in terms of food security and malnutrition in the world, focusing attention on the problems associated with the dissemination of initiatives aimed at addressing such a global challenge. The research was conducted following the tripartition model both in the analysis of the problem and in the proposed answer model, although the business perspective was the privileged one. Encouraging the proper and effective implementation of an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable local market for RUTFs means creating shared values, acting jointly, and maximizing the results in favour of children and their families who are still fighting for the right to live in dignity.","Ethical Issues; Ppp; Rutfs; Sdgs; Sustainable Business Model","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160115236"

Within the framework of sustainable development, agriculture has dimensions as a complex ecosystem of which biodiversity and productivity must be maintained. Accordingly, organic agriculture is an agricultural system that holistically pays attention to the sustainability of biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activities. The problems faced by farmers are the attack of disease-causing pathogens; the level of pathogen attack can even cause crop failure. Phytophthora infestans is a pathogen that causes root, stem, and leaf disease, and this disease is hazardous for plants. Phytophthora infestans are challenging to control, easily transmitted, and have the highest virulence when the plant is in the vegetative period. Therefore, this research aims to determine the level of effectiveness of BIOTRICO in controlling Phytophthora infestans by using experimental method in CV Agrolestari Merbabu. From the experimental results, BIOTRICO was able to minimize the attack of pathogens to only 20%, much lower than the control (60%) and proven capability to become a better option in root, stem, and leaf disease than chemical pesticides for sustainable agricultural practice.","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122211758"

Hidden hunger is the presence of multiple micronutrient deficiencies (particularly iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A), which can occur without a deficit in energy intake as a result of consuming an energy-dense, but nutrient-poor diet. It is estimated that it affects more than two billion people worldwide, particularly in low-and middle-income countries where there is a reliance on low-cost food staples and where the diversity of the diet is limited. Finding a way to improve the nutritional quality of diets for the poorest people is central to meeting the UN sustainable development goals particularly sustainable development goal 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. As we pass the midpoint of the UN's Decade for Action on Nutrition, it is timely to reflect on progress towards achieving sustainable development goal 2 and the strategies to reduce hidden hunger. Many low-and middle-income countries are falling behind national nutrition targets, and this has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other recent shocks to the global food system which have disproportionately impacted the world's most vulnerable communities. Addressing inequalities within the food system must be central to developing a sustainable, cost-effective strategy for improving food quality that delivers benefit to the seldom heard and marginalised communities.","Biofortification; Dietary Supplementation; Micronutrient Intake; Sustainable Development Goals; Iodine; Iron; Retinol; Zinc; Micronutrients; Iodine; Iron; Retinol; Trace Element; Zinc; Biofortification; Caloric Intake; Community; Conference Paper; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cost; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Diet Supplementation; Dietary Diversity; Field Study; Food Fortification; Food Quality; Food Security; Hidden Hunger; Human; Hunger; Low Income Country; Micronutrient Intake; Middle Income Country; Nutrient; Nutrient Density; Nutrient Poor Diet; Nutrition; Nutritional Deficiency; Nutritional Value; Pandemic; Staple Food; Sustainable Agriculture; Sustainable Development Goal; Agriculture; Diet; Dietary Supplement; Eating; Fortified Food; Global Health; Malnutrition; Nutritional Status; Poverty; United Nations; Agriculture; Biofortification; Covid-19; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Eating; Food Security; Food, Fortified; Global Health; Humans; Hunger; Malnutrition; Micronutrients; Nutritional Status; Nutritive Value; Poverty","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104936805"

The Chernozem originally defined by Dokuchaev in 1883 is the central concept of Black Soils but, more than 140 years on, these soils have been much changed by human intervention and there is a need for a new definition-including Chernozem but, also, other soils with similar properties. The term Black Soils is taken to encompass Chernozem, Kastanozem and Phaeozem-all characterized by thick, dark-coloured, humus-rich topsoil originally developed under grassland. Chernozems, in particular, are known for their granular structure, optimal bulk density, and goodly stock of plant nutrients; however, all these favorable properties are only present in soils within virgin ecosystems that are now rare. Black Soils make up only 7% of the land surface but they are of fundamental importance to food security; UN Sustainable Development Goal 2-to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030-will only be achieved if we introduce a mandatory framework for their sustainable management. Sustainable management means arrest of soil erosion, compaction, salinity, sodicity, pollution and soil sealing; maintenance of protective cover, a stable stock of soil organic matter both as a store of plant nutrients and as a carbon sink; maintenance of capacity to infiltrate and hold rainfall and irrigation water but drain any excess to streams and groundwater; and conservation of biodiversity to maintain essential soil functions.","Chernozem; Kastanozem; Phaeozem; Soil Organic Matter; Sustainable Soil Management","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150671949"

It has had devastating effects on cereals with yield losses sometimes reaching 100%, and yet, there are no confirmed means of managing the pest. This militates against the achievement of sustainable development goal (SDG) number 2 which seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. It also impedes the achievement of SDGs 1 and 3 which, respectively, seek to end poverty and ensure good health and the wellbeing of all people, particularly people in resource-constrained societies. Thus, the experiments conducted in the study were aimed at determining the effect that maize genotypes and planting time had on fall armyworm (FAW) damage in a bid to minimise yield losses and concomitantly ensure food security. The results indicated that late planting resulted in a significant 40% increase in the incidence of FAW attack compared to early and medium planted maize crops. Consequently, early planting gave a significantly higher yield by 122% compared to late planting. In contrast, there were no significant effects of genotypes on the number of plants affected by FAW. The study concluded that early planting is effective in reducing FAW attack on maize and results in increased maize productivity in FAW endemic areas.","Early Planting; Fall Armyworm; Genotypes; Spodoptera Frugiperda; Zea Mays","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194557255"

There have been concerns about the capacity of rigid traditional means of food production to meet the demands of the growing world population in view of several challenges including diminishing land for agricultural use, soil degradation, and adverse climatic conditions. It is on this premise that government in Nigeria has been putting polices and legislative measures in place to ensure that food is available and accessible by all persons. This study explores the place of technological solutions like high-yielding crop varieties, development of new biotechnology based on genetic modification in enhancing food production and ultimately, food security. In achieving technological innovation, the law plays an indispensable role. Furthermore, it is also imperative for the law to evolve to embrace areas like Intellectual Property Rights in agriculture if only in the spirit of facilitating food security and economic development. Otherwise, achieving Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals which strives to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture will be no more than mere theoretical postulations","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130955987"

Based on the analysis, the study finds that for male household, ICT utilization has a statistically significant and positive nexus with food security. In contrast, for the female households, an insignificant and, however, negative nexus is observed with food security in Nigeria. Furthermore, the findings show that for male household users, a 1 percent increase in male household ICT utilization spurs about 0.68 percent increase in food security in Nigeria. The findings imply that among the male and female household ICT users, the male household ICT utilization is significantly contributes to food security in Nigeria. The study recommends that relevant stakeholders take strategic measures to ensure that the potentials of household ICTs be fully maximized to contribute to food security in the nearest future as confirmed by studies in other regions.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120084882"

Applying a food-water-technology nexus (FWTN) perspective, we conduct a case study on an emerging technology in urban agricultural production in Germany. The technology connects the wastewater treatment system and the agricultural production system and projects the transformation of a conventional sewage treatment plant into a ‘NEWtrient®-Center,’ which draws the essential resources for urban hydroponic plant cultivation from municipal wastewater. Building on qualitative and participatory research methods, the study provides deeper insights into the governance implications of FWTN issues stemming from the emerging technology. The analysis shows that this technology has the potential to facilitate SDG implementation, but simultaneously fuels new sector interlinkages between water and food and policy demands that substantiate the need for more integrated policymaking to ensure the smart use of technology to reach the SDGs.","Cross-sectoral Governance; Food-water-technology Nexus; Germany; Participatory Research Method; Sdg Implementation; Technology Innovation; Urban Agriculture; Wastewater Treatment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102428909"

The Breeding and management practices of indigenous bovine breeds: Solutions towards a sustainable future (BOVISOL) project is a scientific cooperation between three Mediterranean countries (Greece, Tunisia and Algeria) supported and funded by the European Commission under the European Research Area Networks (ERA-NET) scheme of the 7th Framework Programme. This project has been formed around the hypothesis that the local bovine breeds must be preserved since they possess a valuable genetic pool, and they are a part of the landscape and the biodiversity of rural areas. Moreover, their products (milk, cheese, meat, etc.) could contribute significantly to the local economies as they could easily be associated with recent food trends like “local” and “slow food”, which are considered today, as, not only a mean of nutrition, but also a way of living and a part of people’s identity. BOVISOL project aims to: (i) identify the local breeds and populations in a national level, (ii) describe the existing farm and breeding practices, (iii) analyze the quality of the main local animal products, (iv) propose solutions that will promote the sustainability of the traditional farming systems, especially nowadays that climate change proposes new challenges on animal production, and (v) disseminate the solutions on all the levels of the sector (farmers, scientists, local communities, governmental agencies).","Animal Products; Climate Change; Local Bovine Breeds; Mediterranean Basin; Sustainability; Traditional Farming Systems; Biodiversity; Cattle; Cultivar; European Commission; Food Security; Globalization; Indigenous Population; Livestock Farming; Reproductive Behavior; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Urbanization; Algeria; Greece; Tunisia; Bovinae","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096749145"

We review the literature on a set of 77 ISO standards related to SDG 2 and study existing evidence pertinent to SDG 2 and its targets. Specifically, we review research in four key areas of interest: agricultural productivity of ISO certified firms, adoption of ISO standards amongst small scale producers, ISO standards development, and governance of standards. We found implicit evidence in the literature that ISO standards have the potential to contribute to two SDG 2 targets, namely targets 2.3 and 2.4. Some aspects of ISO standards, however, such as low levels of adoption amongst small scale farmers or a lack of multi-stakeholder standard development, contradict key aspects of the SDG agenda.

This article examines whether policies of five donors on food security and agriculture in the Pacific Islands region are likely to help to achieve SDG2. Fundamentally, the current and future wellbeing of many Pacific Island peoples, many of whom live on small, geographically dispersed islands with limited market access, is strongly tied to their abilities to produce food for themselves. This is somewhat overlooked by bilateral donors from Australia and New Zealand who invest relatively small amounts in the agriculture sector of Pacific countries and show little interest in supporting people's food security through local sourcing and production for subsistence. From an SDG2 perspective of ending hunger for all people, it is positive to see that, by contrast, two multilaterals have shown commitment to a more balanced and holistic approach to food production in the Pacific Islands region.","Agriculture; Donors; Food Security; Pacific Islands; Sustainable Development Goal 2; Agriculture; Food Production; Food Security; Holistic Approach; Strategic Approach; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Australia; New Zealand; Pacific Islands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074768504"

Evidence from the literature suggests that >800 million people worldwide are food insecure. Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) is the largest social safety net of the Government of Bangladesh targeting ultra-poor women to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Objectives: The objective of this study is to explore the factors associated with food security among VGD women in Bangladesh. Methods: A total of 870 women (435/group) participated in the baseline survey and another 800 women (400/group) participated in the endline survey. Participants in the intervention group received monthly rations of 30 kg fortified rice (FFR) and the control group received 30 kg of non-FFR for 12 mo. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to establish both crude and confounder-adjusted relations between the primary outcome and response variables. Written consent was proved by study participants. This study (PR-14091) was approved by the Research Review Committee and Ethical Review Committee. Results: Severe food insecurity in the endline survey decreased from ∼50% to 6.3% in both groups. The hunger scale also improved between the baseline and endline survey. More than 97% of respondents at endline reported no hunger compared with 80% at baseline; only 3% of women in both groups reported moderate hunger at endline. Multivariable regression model showed that ownership of a house and land for agriculture, wealth index (richest quintile), and absence of fever were significantly associated with food security (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our analysis shows that the VGD rice distribution program significantly improves the food security status of vulnerable women; however, ownership of a house and land for agriculture were the most significant factors associated with household food security in VGD program areas of Bangladesh.","Assessment; Food Insecurity; Food Security; Social Safety Net; Women; Adult; Agricultural Land; Article; Bangladesh; Controlled Study; Electricity; Family Size; Female; Fever; Food Assistance; Food Insecurity; Food Security; Fortified Food; Health Program; Household; Household Economic Status; Housewife; Housing; Human; Hunger; Male; Nutritional Requirement; Poultry; Prevalence; Priority Journal; Purchasing; Rice; Vulnerable Population","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083992957"

While undernutrition is of minimal concern in the European Union Member States, trends in childhood obesity are still alarming and far from any desirable target. European food production systems have improved over the last years, with immediate impact on several environmental aspects; however, a comprehensive regulatory framework to fulfil the environmental and climate targets is still lacking.

SDG 2 seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. This reflects a broad international consensus on the unacceptability of hunger articulated previously at the 1996 World Food Summit and reiterated at the 2008 High-Level Conference on World Food Security. In 2009, at their L’Aquila Summit, the G8 heads of state and government pledged a significant expansion of aid to agriculture, in order to address the global food-price spike of the preceding year. However, serious global policy incoherence severely undermines this apparent political will to end hunger and boost developing-country agriculture. In particular, although official development assistance to agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (hunger’s center of gravity) doubled between 2003 and 2012, the share of total global aid going to agriculture, at just 5% in 2014, is well below the 20% share of the mid-1980s. In addition, donor-country agricultural trade and security policies often undercut support for agricultural development in the Global South. Furthermore, there is incoherence within donor policies on aid to agriculture, which tend to focus more on promoting commercialization and exports than on boosting smallholder productivity and the economic empowerment of women farmers. For their part, developing-country governments have not fulfilled pledges to increase their own agricultural development budgets (as seen in the African Union Declarations of Maputo and Malabo), and the bulk of those budgets go to recurrent expenditure rather than development investments. In Sub-Saharan Africa, military expenditures account for a greater share of public funds. This paper suggests that while policy makers in both the Global South and North treat food security and agricultural development as priorities, these remain in a relatively low position on policy agendas because other concerns respond to much stronger constituencies.","Agriculture; Aid; Food Security; Hunger; Policy Coherence; Smallholder Farmers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098720745"

This study attempts a local-level support for the actualisation of Sustainable Development Goal Number 2 (“end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”) by 2030. Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, remote sensing data from Climate Research Unit (CRU) and in-situ data from Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) were analyzed by GIS techniques to map the suitability of rice cultivation in the study area, with the integration of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land cover, slope, temperature, precipitation and soil parameters (cation exchange capacity, pH, bulk density, organic carbon). We apply the various statistical parameters that include mean spatial NDVI; correlation coefficient, standard deviation and Root Mean Square (RMS) between CRU and NIMET data. Spatial regression trend analysis is conducted between CRU precipitation and NDVI and between CRU temperature and NDVI from 1985 to 2015. The results reveal that NDVI in highly suitable rice planting regions is higher than marginally suitable regions except in the months of October and November, which shows that the highly suitable regions will yield better than the marginally suitable regions during the dry season. Additionally, NDVI is seasonally bimodal in response to precipitation, meaning that vegetation vigor is more dependent on precipitation than temperature. Finally, the correlation coefficient, standard deviation and RMS between CRU and NIMET precipitation data shows 0.42, 108, and 110, respectively, while these three factors between CRU and NIMET temperature data shows 0.88, 1.60, and 0.86, respectively. In conclusion, the MCDM approach reveals that upland is more suitable for rice cultivation in Benue State when comparing with the area provided by the Global Land Cover and National Mappings Organization (GLCNMO) data.","Benue State; Cru Data; Nimet Data; Rice Cultivation; Suitability Mapping; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Agricultural Robots; Cultivation; Decision Making; Food Supply; Mapping; Organic Carbon; Planning; Remote Sensing; Sustainable Development; Vegetation; Benue State; Cation Exchange Capacities; Cru Data; Multi-criteria Decision Making; Nimet Data; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Rice Cultivation; Sustainable Agriculture; Population Statistics; Crop Production; Cultivation; Ndvi; Rice; Satellite Data; Satellite Imagery; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Vegetation Mapping; Benue; Nigeria","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068898591"

The 2nd United Nations Sustainable Development Goal aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. Yet whether improving nutritional quality also benefits the environment is still under-explored, particularly for developing countries. China is an interesting and important case because of its rapidly changing dietary patterns distinct from the western countries studied in the literature, sub-national level heterogeneity, socio-economic characteristics and lifestyles, as well as its considerable population. This paper evaluates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, and land appropriation resulting from shifting the Chinese population to healthy diets. We quantify the environmental impacts of individual diets using the latest available data of China Health and Nutrition Survey (2011), and compare them with the environmental impacts of suggested healthy dietary patterns in accordance with the 2016 Chinese Dietary Guidelines. If all Chinese would follow healthy diets rather than their current diets revealed in the survey, GHG emissions, water consumption, and land occupation would increase by 7.5% (63.9 Mt CO<inf>2</inf>e annually), 53.5% (510 billion m3), and 54.2% (1256 billion m2), respectively. Urban and high-income groups have higher diet-related environmental impacts but could achieve less additional environmental impacts when moving to healthier diets. These findings indicate an expense of increased GHG emissions, and consumption of water and land resources in improving health. They also highlight the need to focus on the effects of improved economic conditions and urbanization in reconciling environmental impacts and human nutritional adequacy.","China; Diet Change; Greenhouse Gases; Land; Malnutrition; Water; Sodium Chloride; Oil; Sodium Chloride; Developing World; Diet; Emission; Environmental Impact; Greenhouse Gas; Land Use; Malnutrition; Nutrition; Water Use; Age; Animal Product; Article; Body Height; Body Weight; Cereal; China; Chinese; Consumer Attitude; Dairy Product; Developing Country; Dietary Pattern; Egg; Fluid Intake; Food Composition; Food Intake; Food Security; Fruit; Grain; Health Hazard; Healthy Diet; Human; Hunger; Lifestyle; Lowest Income Group; Meat; Nut; Nutritional Value; Occupation; Physical Activity; Plant Tuber; Sea Food; Sex; Social Status; Socioeconomics; Soybean; Sustainable Agriculture; Sustainable Development; Total Quality Management; Urbanization; Vegetable; Catering Service; Environment; Diet; Environment; Food Supply; Humans; Quality Improvement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064158682"

The first of these is: 'End poverty in all its forms everywhere'. The second is to: 'End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture'. Food safety is a global priority, since every global citizen has the right to have access to safe and nutritious food. Safe food contributes to people's health and productivity, as well as providing a strong foundation for development and poverty alleviation. Every year, numerous people are affected by foodborne illnesses in developed countries, while widespread illness is even more likely in developing countries. Among society's major concerns are the health risks posed by microbial pathogens and chemicals in food. A One Health approach is crucial to achieving the global goal of food safety and security for all and will improve health outcomes for every citizen.; En 2015, l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies a adopté les 17 Objectifs de développement durable pour le monde. Le premier de ces objectifs est d’éliminer l’extrême pauvreté partout dans le monde. Le deuxième s’énonce comme suit : « éliminer la faim, assurer la sécurité alimentaire, améliorer la nutrition et promouvoir l’agriculture durable ». La sécurité sanitaire des aliments constitue une priorité mondiale, dans la mesure où chaque citoyen doit pouvoir accéder à des aliments sains et nutritifs. Une alimentation saine contribue à la santé et productivité des individus, en plus de fournir une base solide au développement et à la réduction de la pauvreté. Chaque année dans les pays développés, les maladies transmises par les aliments touchent un nombre élevé de personnes tandis que le risque de propagation à grande échelle de ces maladies est encore plus présent dans les pays en développement. Les risques pour la santé liés à la présence d’agents pathogènes et de résidus chimiques dans les aliments figurent parmi les grandes préoccupations de la société d’aujourd’hui. L’approche Une seule santé est indispensable pour atteindre l’objectif mondial d’assurer la sécurité sanitaire des aliments et leur disponibilité pour tous, tout en améliorant l’état de santé de tous les citoyens.; En 2015, la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas acordó definir 17 Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible de alcance mundial. El primero de ellos reza así: «Poner fin a la pobreza en todas sus formas en todo el mundo», y el segundo así: «Poner fin al hambre, lograr la seguridad alimentaria y la mejora de la nutrición y promover la agricultura sostenible». La inocuidad de los alimentos es una prioridad de dimensión planetaria, pues todo ciudadano del mundo tiene derecho a disfrutar de una alimentación segura y nutritiva. La inocuidad de los alimentos contribuye a la salud y productividad de las personas, además de sentar sólidas bases para el desarrollo y la reducción de la pobreza. Cada año, muchas personas padecen enfermedades de transmisión alimentaria en países desarrollados, mientras que en los países en desarrollo es incluso más probable la extensión generalizada de esas patologías. Entre las grandes preocupaciones de la sociedad están los riesgos para la salud que derivan de la presencia en los alimentos de patógenos microbianos y productos químicos. El hecho de trabajar en clave de Una sola salud, indispensable para cumplir el objetivo mundial de garantizar a todos la inocuidad de los alimentos y la seguridad alimentaria, también redundará en mejores resultados sanitarios para todos y cada uno de los ciudadanos.","Food Safety; Food Security; Foodborne Illness; One Health; Poverty; Sustainable Development Goals; Agriculture; Animal; Catering Service; Global Health; Human; Hunger; One Health; United Nations; Agriculture; Animals; Food Supply; Global Health; Humans; Hunger","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072745535"

Evidence suggests that the urban poor who pursue agriculture in the city as a livelihood are more food secure. Thus, it could be assumed that migrants involved in urban agriculture are also in a better position to meet nutritional needs. The aim of this research was to explore household food security among migrant urban farmers using data from studies conducted in three rapidly urbanizing cities: Delhi, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; and, Quito, Ecuador. Surveys and semi-structured interviews were conducted with market-oriented small-to-medium scale farmers in each city to understand livelihood and migrant status, household food consumption patterns, and food security. In general, we found that participation in urban agriculture had a positive impact on household food security among participants through direct (self-consumption) and indirect (improved income, improved access) means. Although each case city expressed a different form of low-income migrant practice of urban agriculture, findings suggest that growing food in the city offers some protection against food insecurity through improved quantity, quality, and diversity of food options. This study is particularly relevant in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. These factors guide development goals and priorities. Given that rural-urban migrant trends are predicted to continue, this exploratory study offers empirical evidence related to rural-urban migrants, food security, and urban agriculture.","Delhi; Ecuador; Household Food Security; India; Indonesia; Jakarta; Market-oriented Agriculture; Quito; Rural-urban Migration; Urban Agriculture; Agricultural Market; Food Consumption; Food Security; Household Survey; Low Income Population; Migrant Worker; Sustainable Development; Urban Agriculture; Urban-rural Migration; Delhi; Ecuador; India; Indonesia; Jakarta; Pichincha; Quito","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062835056"

This need is recognized in UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) – “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”. To this end, research and development institutions such as the Global Horticultural Initiative (GHI) and the World Vegetable Center have embraced the concept of Horticulture for Sustainable Development (H4sD) with the aim of reducing micronutrient deficiency through the increased production and consumption of fruit and vegetables. Increased fruit and vegetable production brings many other benefits to people, such as enhanced income for smallholder farmers and other value chain participants, employment opportunities throughout the value chain, empowerment of women, and more sustainable agriculture when it is incorporated as part of an agricultural diversification program. Thus, fruit and vegetable horticulture has great potential to contribute directly to several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero hunger) and SDG 12 (“Responsible consumption and production”). This paper showcases recent evidence for the impact of international vegetable research and development done by the World Vegetable Center in collaboration with its partners, notably those in the GHI and in the public and private sectors. It highlights the impact of three major areas of the Center’s work: breeding improved lines of globally important and traditional niche vegetables; developing improved production technologies, such as those aimed at off-season vegetable production; and training poor rural women in household gardening and nutrition.

Climate change related hazards such as floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, droughts and other risks can weaken food security and severely impact agricultural activities. Consequently, this has an impact on market access, trade, food supply, reduced income, increased food prices, decreased farm income and employment. Natural disasters create poverty, which in turn increases the prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition. It is clear that disasters put food security at risk. The poorest people in the community are affected by food insecurity and disasters; hence, there is a need to be prepared as well as be in a position to manage disasters. Without serious efforts to address them, the risks of disasters will become an increasingly serious obstacle to sustainable development and the achievement of sustainable development goals, particularly goal number 2 'end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture'. In recent years, countries in southern Africa have experienced an increase in the frequency, magnitude and impact of climate change-related hazards such as droughts, veld fire, depleting water resources and flood events. This research aims to reveal Southern African Development Community disaster risk management strategies for food security to see how they an influence and shape policy at the national level in southern Africa. Sustainable Livelihood approach was adopted as the main theoretical framework for the study. The qualitative Analysis is based largely on data from databases such as national reports, regional reports and empirical findings on the disaster management-sustainable development nexus.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047128817"

However, many of the other SDGs have the potential to improve nutrition outcomes through more indirect pathways. Using the UNICEF conceptual framework to guide our analysis, we examined the ways in which different SDGs could influence nutrition and health outcomes, and the pathways by which this could occur. However, large data gaps exist making it difficult to accurately assess the current state of SDGs in many countries and regions. In order to increase accountability for the SDGs, the existing gaps in data collection must be addressed. This will enable countries to examine both the indirect and the direct pathways to improving nutrition outcomes globally.","Malnutrition; Nutrition Policy; Sustainable Development Goals","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077606227"

Much has happened in less than 10 years to redefine the international nutrition landscape and place nutrition at the heart of global development efforts. The food crises of 2008 and the Lancet first series on maternal and child undernutrition helped galvanize world attention. The enormous health and economic consequences of malnutrition were recognized, and far more attention began to be paid to the multiple burdens of malnutrition. In 2014, the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) endorsed 2 outcome documents, committing world leaders to establishing national policies aimed at eliminating malnutrition in all its forms, including hidden hunger, and transforming food systems to make nutritious diets available to all. In 2015, 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global objectives to guide the actions of the international community over the next 15 years (2016-2030). Member States placed high priority on addressing malnutrition in all its forms by committing, under SDG 2, to ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."" However, nutrition has also a role to play in achieving other goals of the 2030 Agenda, including goals related to poverty, health, education, social protection, gender, water, work, growth, inequality, and climate change. In 2016, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the ICN2 outcome documents and proclaimed the years 2016-2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Nutrition Decade reaffirmed the commitments under the ICN2 and the 2030 Agenda to end malnutrition in all its forms. Together, the ICN2, the 2030 Agenda, and the Nutrition Decade have placed nutrition firmly at the heart of the development agenda with the recognition that transformed food systems have a fundamental role to play in promoting healthy diets and improving nutrition. This paper reviews the major international nutrition system changes called for, and provides an analysis of recent governance initiatives to address malnutrition in all its forms, including hidden hunger problems.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045315672"

Every child, every woman, and every man has the right to live on healthy, diverse, and affordable food. It is the premise of a healthy, productive, and self-determined life. Yet, there are not only 800 million people going to bed hungry every day, there are also 2 billion people who suffer from hidden hunger, lacking valuable micronutrients like vitamins, zinc, or iron. They are more often ill, too weak to work in the fields, or to go to school. Of these, 80% of the people live in rural areas, 26% of children under 5 years are stunted, and 3 million children die every year as a consequence of hidden hunger. The causes of hidden hunger are as diverse as the consequences: Cultivating monocultures depletes soils of nutrients and people in poverty want to fill their stomachs before they worry about a balanced diet. The quality of food is subordinated to its quantity and many women and men never learn about the importance of healthy nutrition or their right to it. This shows the challenges that are posed for sustainable development and, thus, for international development cooperation. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) take up these challenges and provide a framework for tackling them. Although SDG 2 ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"" is the most prominent goal in relation to hidden hunger, most of the other goals are related to it as they are either a prerequisite or an outcome of the action against hidden hunger. In its strategic framework, Bread for the World sets out different focal sectors, all of which tackle, either directly or indirectly, causes and consequences of hidden hunger. One of the sectors addresses sustainable agriculture and rural development, where projects are implemented by partner organizations worldwide and concern not just the quantity, but also and especially the quality of food. Yet, the majority of incoming funding requests are not concerned with hidden hunger directly. Yet a variety of project approaches consider influencing factors for hidden hunger. Additionally, every 3 years, Bread for the World chooses a motto under which it engages deeply with a certain topic in diverse ways. From 2014 to 2017, this motto is ""Sated is not enough!"". This approach allows attention to be directed to the phenomenon of hidden hunger in all its dimensions and helps to contribute to the solution of that global challenge with the international community.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045299247"

The framework can be used to apply exergy-based indicators for pinpointing the hotspots in food production chains where the irreversible consumption of natural resources is substantial, and for comparing the resource use efficiency of different system designs and configurations.

Widespread hunger and poverty continue to be among the most life-threatening problems confronting mankind. Available statistics show that global poverty remains a serious challenge around the world. Across the globe, one in five people lives on less than $1 a day and one in seven suffers from chronic hunger. Similarly, the developing world is adversely affected by poverty and hunger. In the sub-Saharan Africa, research has revealed a higher prevalence of hunger, malnutrition, poverty and food insecurity. SDG 2 focuses more on eliminating hunger and promoting sustainable agriculture. The study employed an exploratory design and a qualitative method. Snowball sampling was used in selecting relevant sources which led the researchers to other research work on the same field through keywords and reference lists. The researchers employed discourse analysis to analyse data. The study discovered that there are numerous potential effects climate change could have on agriculture. It affects crop growth and quality and livestock health. Farming practices could also be affected as well as animals that could be raised in particular climatic areas. The impact of climate change as well as the susceptibility of poor communities is very immense. The article concludes that climate change reduces access to drinking water, negatively affects the health of people and poses a serious threat to food security.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014684612"

The main goal is to develop the agriculture sector to be able to attain food self sufficiency, uplift the rural community and increase the income of the farmers. Agriculture’s contribution to the economy is estimated to be about 40 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of jobs arise from agriculture. However, agricultural sector has been beset with persistent challenges resulting in low farm incomes, low rural employment, lack of food security, and meager agricultural competitiveness. Among the 17 targeted areas of the Global Sustainable Development Goals, the Philippines should specifically pursue the goals to end/minimize hunger, achieve food security, improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The status of Philippine agriculture as well as the challenges and strategies for sustainable development were discussed. Challenges identified were lack of important provisions that will guarantee food security and reduce poverty in the countryside, lack of programs that will link agriculture with the industry, and insufficient activities aimed to vigorously transfer advanced production, post- harvest, and processing technologies to the stakeholders, among others. The University of the Philippines (UPLB), as the premier university offering agricultural degrees in the country serves as the leader in developing network of an integrated system in agriculture education that effectively responds to the challenges faced by the agriculture sector. For instance, UPLB’s programs in the attainment of food and nutrition security as well as its visions in internationalization were discussed. Programs and plans on responsive and innovative teaching methods and strengthen RDE integration were adopted, geared towards the achievement of the four dimensions of food security.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959301445"
