Traditional approaches to permanent lifelong educator training often fail to produce lasting changes in teaching practices (UN, Goal 4). This paper examines how educator involvement in a professional learning community (PLC) ensures equitable quality education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for all and a sustainable digital transformation of the teaching and learning process. Participation in PLC and the use of contemporary learning environments positively impact the quality of educators’ work, thereby enhancing the overall educational process. This study utilised a quantitative methodology, employing both descriptive and inferential statistics to analyse the data. Results indicate that a balanced integration of formal PLC structures and guidance, combined with elements of a non-formal, broader PLC and external incentives and support (such as projects), can surpass mere exchanges of best practices, foster innovation, and support the sustainable digital transformation of educators. This approach leads to a sustainable shift in pedagogical paradigms. The PLC_IP model (focused on including digital technologies and effective teaching strategies) enhances collective educator efficacy, contributing to improved teaching quality. For PLCs to achieve sustainability, they must be dynamic entities that adapt to the evolving educational landscape, ensuring their continued relevance and impact with rising completion rates over time. Our findings underscore the importance of innovative PLCs in driving sustainable educational development and improvement and provide a framework for future research and practical applications in educational settings. In addition, PLCs can strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development (UN, Goal 17).","Education Practices; Esd; Professional Learning Communities; Schools; Sustainable Change; Sustainable Education; Training; Digitization; Educational Development; Learning; Sustainable Development; Teacher Training; Teaching","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199890585"

Partnership is a key strategy for acquiring skills, information and private finance for developing critical infrastructure projects. Existing studies have mostly concentrated on identifying critical success factors (CSFs) for successfully delivering public–private partnerships (PPPs) projects, but the interrelationships among CSFs expected from stakeholders have garnered less attention. The purpose of this study is to examine the interconnections among CSFs of PPP projects while keeping the public in mind, as well as the influencing routes that contribute to success in the PPP implementation process. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a mixed-method approach that involves both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. The data for the study were collected through a well-structured questionnaire from the respondents who are directly or indirectly associated with the PPP project implementation process. The CSF’s framework was built using a literature study and expert interviews; nine hypotheses were developed and evaluated using structural equation modelling. Random and purposive sampling techniques were used for the respondents who were directly or indirectly associated with the PPP project implementation process. Findings: The findings of this study reveal that the relationship between public and private partners is more adherent than collaborative, with unequal responsibilities, powers and resources distributed among the parties involved. The relevance of state rules, the PPP directive and policies in PPP implementation is supported by the positive connection between favourable environments (Fav_Env) and government attributes (Gov_Atr; the path coefficient is 0.405). Moreover, government attributes have a favourable influence on private company attributes (Pvt_Atr; the path coefficient is 0.198), showing that the state plays a substantial role in the private sector’s decision-making process in PPP. The long-term sustainability and success of a PPP project are dependent on the established interrelationships between CSFs. Practical implications: The established interrelationships between CSFs will contribute to the long-term viability and success of a PPP project. Since PPP is still in its infancy in India, the study of CSFs in PPPs and their interrelationships will help policymakers and other stakeholders better understand the major individual factors impacting the success or failure of PPP initiatives. Originality/value: Because PPP is still in its infancy in India, the study of CSFs in PPPs and their interrelationships will help policymakers and other stakeholders to better understand the major individual factors impacting the success or failure of PPP initiatives. A key implication of the study borders on providing a better understanding of the relationships between CSFs and public engagement. This is also critical for the long-term viability of PPPs and the enhancement of public service quality.","Infrastructure; Public–private Partnerships; Sustainable Development; Value For Money (vfm)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173945411"

It discusses the SDG 17 called “Partnerships for the Goals. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development”, devoting particular attention to how this SDG has been found in a blurred vision of collaboration. Actually, there has been much rhetoric about enhancing multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development including the government, business sector, non-government organizations, academia, social partners, and civil society. However, reporting the difficulties and unmitigated success is not common.

The complex character of sustainability requires the participation of many societal spheres to resolve them. Sustainable Development Goal #17 “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development” recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as important vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technologies, and financial resources to support the achievement of the SDGs in all countries. Innovation Ecosystems (IE) are dynamic purposive multi-stakeholders' networks with complex relationships built on trust, co-creation of value, and exchange of complementary technologies or competencies. Few studies investigated the IEs relating to sustainability and specially within the SDGs. This study provides a descriptive analysis of the relationship between IE and the SDGs, concerning the question about how the IE framework can orient the SDG #17 partnership implementation. The methodology is based on the literature review and analysis of documents from the United Nations, available at the UN Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform - 2021. Four core drivers were identified and discussed: Geographical Governance, Collaboration, Knowledge Transmission, and Value co-creation. Considering the IE lens, the SDGs can be addressed as the purpose engaging the Major Groups, which are the key contributors in terms of being part of the challenges and solutions. There is a need to prepare stakeholders to be ecosystem conscious and aware of the demanded innovations. Future research should include describing methods to measure IE performance considering the SDGs and empirical studies to analyze the ecosystem roles and relations of the Major Groups.","Governance; Innovation Ecosystem; Management; Multi-stakeholders' Partnership; Sustainable Development Goals; Value Co-creation; Empirical Analysis; Implementation Process; Innovation; Partnership Approach; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104321340"

Environmental policies are connected with other development policies carried out by governments. In order to comprehensively shape environmental policy, it is important to understand the interactions between sustainable development goals (SDGs) as well as their impact on environmental goals. Employing econometric modeling based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method and full-factorial analysis, the authors identify a number of statistically significant relationships between the implementation of sustainable development goals and the environmental variable represented by greenhouse gas emissions. Analysis reveals that implementation of particular sustainable development goals, namely SDG4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities) and SDG17 (Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development), explicitly facilitate the achievement of environmental policies. In addition, other SDGs exert an indirect influence on environmental goals through their reinforcing interactions with SDG4 and SDG17 variables. These are: SDG1 (End poverty), SDG3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being), SDG8 (Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and productive employment) and SDG15 (Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests and halt biodiversity loss).

The study presents an illustrative stakeholder situation, where we see that there are conflicting interests among conservationists, fishermen, municipality representatives, and others. Data collection was done using desk-based research and semi-structured interviews. The interview process was performed between October 2018 and October 2019. In total, 21 different stakeholders were interviewed. For the data analyses, a stakeholder register, Power-Interest Matrices, and a stakeholder map were used, and, to complement the latter, narratives were developed. The different analyses showed that most project stakeholders supported the project, while there was really only one stakeholder, the fishermen themselves, who were reticent about participating. However, it was shown over time that, by developing a common vision with them, the fishermen came on board the project and collaborated with the scientists. Stakeholder engagement analyses are especially useful in the application of Sustainable Development Goals at the project level. Although this case study is specifically applicable to a marine conservation context, it may be extrapolated and applied to any other Sustainable Development Goals’ context.","Global Alliances; Stakeholder Management; Sustainable Development Goals; Governance Approach; Participatory Approach; Questionnaire Survey; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal; Comunidad Valencia; Spain; Valencia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104468387"

The successful implantation of this goal will aid the execution and achievement of the other sixteen goals. This article explores the importance and viability of SDG 17, “Partnering for the Goals” through the analysis of one marine conservation case study. More specifically the applicability of SDG 17 was analyzed so as to assess the viability of SDG 14, “Life under Water”. This case study evaluated a marine conservation case study based in Normandie (France) that deals with the conservation of bottlenose dolphins. It presents a very interesting stakeholder situation, where we see that there are conflicting interests among governmental authorities, conservation organizations, recreational and commercial fishermen, among others. A case study approach was undertaken for the data collection using desk-based research and semi-structured interviews. The interview process was performed between October 2019 and March 2020. In total, 19 different stakeholders were interviewed. For the data analyses, a stakeholder register, PI Matrices and a stakeholder map were used, and to complement the latter narratives were developed. It was found that most project stakeholders seem to be in favour of the Normand-Breton bottlenose dolphin conservation project, however the recreational and professional fishermen as well as the promoters of renewable energy projects did not appear to support it. Stakeholder engagement analyses are especially useful in the application of SDG at the project level. However, in some instances such as in the case study analysed, many obstacles may be encountered in the process of creating these global alliances and partnerships. Although this case study is specifically applicable to a marine conservation context, it may be extrapolated and applied to any other SDG context.","Global Alliances; Marine Conservation; Stakeholder Management; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107730975"

Policy documents are replete with statements on the necessity of ‘meaningful’ engagement, especially with civil society—without clarifying what ‘meaningful’ stands for. In this article, we develop an analytical approach to partnership as a form and norm of metagovernance. Partnership as a metanorm is about the roles and relations of different sets of actors. We suggest operationalizing the concept of partnership according to different levels of accountability and participation, allowing for a gradual enhancement of the quality of partnership in terms of ‘meaningfulness.’ We apply our analytical model to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-Being for All (GAP), a fairly new initiative by health and development agencies to accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda. By investigating the development and the early phase of implementing the GAP, we empirically assess if and how the notion of partnership envisioned in the GAP qualifies as ‘meaningful’ with respect to civil society engagement. From our empirical example, we infer lessons for attaining normative standards of ‘meaningfulness’ and highlight implications for future research on partnerships.","Accountability; Civil Society Organizations; Global Health; Metagovernance; Participation; Partnership; Sustainable Development Goals","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102415103"

Furthermore, higher education institutions are at the core of such policy. This chapter presents the contribution the Colombian University is making to selected United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs include: SDG 4—Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all; SDG 16—Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels; and SDG 17—Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. The chapter describes the manner in which Colombia University was involved in drafting the National Science and Innovation Policy and document the importance of the University as a fundamental axis for a transformative structure. This is evident in the manner in which the University became a center for the generation and dissemination of knowledge, basic and applied research, and technology transfer. Such academic activities can be aligned with the TIP by following a series of recommendations to develop a public innovation policy that contributes to the country’s achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and its 17 interlinked SDGs.","2030 Agenda; Colombian University; Sdgs; Transformative Innovation Policy","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111132160"

Its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are to be implemented by monitoring processes using the properly selected targets and indicators. Hungary is a partner country in 2030 Agenda implementation. Geographic location is defined as one of the fiducial characteristics by which the SDGs indicators should be disaggregated when the SDGs progression is examined. This is the reason the Geoinformation (GI) and Earth observations (EO) are considered in technical, juridical, institutional, national and international constitutions of the 2030 Agenda. Started in February 2017, SDGs awareness raising campaign was executed by the authors, volunteer members of the Hungarian Society of Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (MFTTT) to mobilize and share knowledges, expertise, technologies and services and to promote public, private and civil partnerships for the Hungarian geospatial stakeholder community. This campaign became an MFTTT achievement, i.e. our clear contribution to implement targets 17.16 and 17.17 of the SD Goal 17 to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the partnership. After giving an introduction and expounding the topic actuality, the article presents the way which led to a more complex strategy of saving our future, namely to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The content of SDGs, its spatial data aspects as well as the relevant UN structure, the international forums assigned to and the GI/EO related organizations involved are shortly introduced. Separate chapter is divided to analyse the SDGs impact on the GI/ EO communities and to cite examples on how the kinds of GI/EO data may serve individual SDGs. Next chapter describes the institutional and juridical background of the implementation of SDGs in Hungary, including the governmental organizations, the professional civil societies and the National Sustainable Development Framework Strategy. Then examples are given on basic and thematic geospatial data handy for SDGs, and relevant geospatial organizations playing role in SDGs are enumerated. It is also discussed how our geospatial data are or are not colligated in national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI). In chapter 7 our multi-stakeholder awareness raising campaign is demonstrated consisting of 8 presentations at professional stakeholder forums, an action with the Hungarian Good State project and the liaison reports to GSDI, two CEOS WGISS plenaries, GEO EO4SDGs Team. Also, we published an article in the MMM-GI international journal to share the MFTTT results on awareness raising campaign in Hungary. Chapter 8 presents challenges and deficiencies. After some acknowledgements authors recommend the MFTTT to continue his civil society stakeholder activity in SDGs. Reduction of the Hungarian NSDI obstacles cannot be delayed: the Agency responsible for NSDI is expected to prepare and the Government is demanded to finalise juridical measures for NSDI constitution. The Agency responsible for NSDI is strongly advised to enter in cooperation with the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH) with purpose of the statistical and spatial data integration for SDGs. Authors recommend the MFTTT to initialize cooperation with the Hungarian Space Office (MŰI) to enhance his Earth Observation Information System project (FIR).","Earth Observations; Geoinformation; Mfttt For Implementation Of The Sustainable Development Goals; National Sustainable Development Framework Strategy; Un 2030 Agenda","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063742478"
