# SDG Multi-Label Classification Research Notes

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating and analyzing multi-label SDG classification datasets using text similarity approaches with embeddings.

## Dataset Creation Process

### 1. Original OSDG Dataset Processing
- **Source**: OSDG community dataset with agreement-based filtering
- **Filtering criteria**: Agreement score â‰¥ 0.6 and positive labels > negative labels
- **Result**: 17,248 high-quality texts from original 32,120 entries
- **Format**: Multi-label with individual SDG binary columns

### 2. SDG Reference Dataset Creation
- **Source**: Agenda 2030 PDF extraction
- **Processing**: Combined SDG goals and targets into paragraph format
- **Result**: 17 clean SDG descriptions for similarity matching
- **Purpose**: Reference text for semantic similarity calculations

### 3. Similarity-Based Multi-Label Dataset
- **Method**: Sentence transformer embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **Similarity calculation**: Cosine similarity between OSDG texts and SDG descriptions
- **Thresholds**: Primary (0.4) and Secondary (0.3) similarity thresholds
- **Result**: Multi-label assignments with 2.53 average labels per text

## Analysis Results (SDG Label Overlap Analysis)

### Overall Performance Metrics
- **Total texts analyzed**: 17,248
- **Overall preservation rate**: 72.50% (12,505 out of 17,248 original labels preserved)
- **Similarity coverage**: 14,025 texts received similarity-based labels (81.3%)
- **Multi-label distribution**: 59% multi-label, 22% single-label, 19% no labels

### SDG-Specific Performance

#### Top Performing SDGs (Preservation Rate):
1. **SDG 14 (Life Below Water)**: 94.6% preservation, 45.2% precision
2. **SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation)**: 91.4% preservation, 47.9% precision
3. **SDG 1 (No Poverty)**: 88.2% preservation, 24.2% precision
4. **SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy)**: 86.3% preservation, 43.3% precision
5. **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption)**: 84.5% preservation, 6.9% precision

#### Environmental SDGs Show Strong Performance:
- SDG 13 (Climate Action): 84.4% preservation, 33.5% precision
- SDG 15 (Life on Land): 72.1% preservation, 42.8% precision

#### Challenging SDGs:
- **SDG 3 (Good Health)**: 45.6% preservation, 50.6% precision
- **SDG 8 (Decent Work)**: 56.0% preservation, 13.4% precision
- **SDG 9 (Industry & Innovation)**: 65.7% preservation, 12.9% precision
- **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)**: 60.9% preservation, 8.8% precision

#### Missing from Original Dataset:
- **SDG 16 (Peace & Justice)**: 0 texts in original, 1,624 in similarity dataset
- **SDG 17 (Partnerships)**: 0 texts in original, 2,256 in similarity dataset

### Key Insights

#### 1. Environmental vs Social SDGs
- **Environmental SDGs** (6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15) show higher preservation rates (72-95%)
- **Social/Economic SDGs** (8, 9, 10) show lower precision, suggesting broader similarity-based assignment

#### 2. Precision vs Coverage Trade-off
- High precision SDGs: SDG 5 (90.8%), SDG 3 (50.6%), SDG 2 (48.4%)
- High coverage SDGs: SDG 8, 9, 10, 11 (large similarity counts but lower precision)

#### 3. Dataset Expansion
- Similarity method successfully expands coverage to previously unrepresented SDGs (16, 17)
- Multi-label approach captures cross-cutting themes better than single-label original

### Technical Implementation

#### Embedding Model Performance
- **Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional embeddings, ~90MB)
- **Processing time**: ~50 seconds for 17,248 texts
- **Average similarity score**: 0.395 (indicating meaningful semantic connections)

#### Threshold Analysis
- **Primary threshold (0.4)**: High-confidence assignments
- **Secondary threshold (0.3)**: Medium-confidence assignments
- **Balance**: Good trade-off between precision and recall

## Future Research Directions

### 1. Threshold Optimization
- Experiment with SDG-specific thresholds based on performance analysis
- Consider adaptive thresholds based on text complexity

### 2. Model Improvements
- Test larger embedding models (all-mpnet-base-v2) for better semantic understanding
- Explore domain-specific fine-tuned models for SDG classification

### 3. Validation Studies
- Human expert validation of multi-label assignments
- Cross-validation with other SDG classification datasets

### 4. Application Development
- Real-time SDG classification system
- Integration with policy document analysis workflows
